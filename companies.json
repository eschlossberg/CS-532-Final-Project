"text":"State Grid Corp, one of the world's biggest utility companies, is pushing to build a global energy network, which is expected to attract investment of $50 trillion by 2050 through a new unit, sources said on Tuesday.\r\n\r\nAlso the largest electric power transmission and distribution company in China, State Grid established a company at the end of last year to develop what its President Liu Zhenya called a \"global energy Internet\" through a massive electricity grid sharing renewables from all over the world.\r\n\r\nIt will be a Beijing-based company with offices in New York, Paris, Rio de Janeiro and Johannesburg, he said at a recent forum on energy investment and funding in Hong Kong.\r\n\r\n\"To create a global energy Internet is to build an energy-related infrastructure covering different countries, including power generation facilities, transmission networks and energy transportation assets,\" said Liu.\r\n\r\nThe State company is studying the feasibility of a pilot program on power transmission not only among Asian countries but also between Asia and Europe as well as Africa and Europe.\r\n\r\nLi Ronghua, its deputy chief engineer, said that a global energy Internet is a huge capital-intensive project, and is expected to attract $50 trillion of investment by 2050.\r\n\r\n\"Investment opportunities will come from major projects such as power development, power grid construction, and research and innovation,\" he said.\r\n\r\nState Grid is building a vast ultra-high voltage transmission network in the world's largest energy-consuming market, and at the same time it plans to leverage its domestic experience to export its technology and equipment abroad, experts said.\r\n\r\nLiu has spoken at different events to promote ultra-high voltage transmission lines, which enable the effective use of clean energy and reduce emission from fossil fuels.\r\n\r\nHe said through such connections clean energy can be distributed, while smart grids, connecting billions of households to the Internet, are the key in the process.\r\n\r\nHuawei Technologies Co Ltd, a Chinese tech giant, is also supporting the global Internet of energy. The company provides technology for State Grid's smart grid.\r\n\r\n\"State Grid has utility assets in many countries but its ultimate goal is to export both grid transmission technology and equipment,\" said Lu Jinyong, a professor at the University of International Business and Economics in Beijing.\r\n\r\nHe said the Chinese company, which has built the largest electricity network in the country, can provide more stable and price-competitive technologies than other countries.\r\n\r\nThe global expansion of State Grid started in 2010, when it acquired a major stake in Brazil's electricity grid."},

"text":"MILAN, Feb 17 (Reuters) - Italian power grid company Terna is ready to work with shareholder State Grid Corp of China on projects outside Europe as it moves to diversify its business and offset lower returns from core regulated operations.\r\n\r\nTerna, one of Europe\u2019s biggest power grid players, makes the lion\u2019s share of its money from returns set by the regulator and designed to allow it to improve the country\u2019s high-voltage transmission grid.\r\n\r\nBut the energy watchdog cut grid returns in December to reflect lower inflation and falling bond yields, prompting Terna to look to non-core business to help boost profits.\r\n\r\nState Grid Corp of China is Terna\u2019s No. 2 shareholder after state-lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), owning 35 percent of a holding which in turn controls 29.9 percent of the company.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe looked at doing projects together outside Europe... we do not exclude doing business with them,\u201D Terna CEO Matteo Del Fante said in a press conference on the group\u2019s 2016-2019 plan.\r\n\r\nHe gave no details.\r\n\r\nDel Fante, a former CDP manager, also said Terna would be looking at overseas growth opportunities in Latin America where the regulatory framework was stable.\r\n\r\nTerna is currently taking part in a bid, alongside a partner, for regulated transmission assets in Chile worth around $200 million.\r\n\r\n\u201CI see no meaningful operations in Europe,\u201D the CEO added, referring to acquisitions.\r\n\r\nTerna, which runs around 64,000 kilometres of power lines in Italy, said 3.3 billion euros would be invested over the next 4 years to improve the domestic grid and links to Europe.\r\n\r\nBut it is increasingly looking to non-core businesses such as telecom services and maintaining third-party solar power plants to boost income as core grid tariffs are capped.\r\n\r\nTerna expects non-regulated business, as well as the recent acquisition of power line assets from the state railway, to boost core earnings to more than 1.6 billion euros in 2019 from 1.53 billion in 2015.\r\n\r\nDividends will grow by 3 percent a year to reach 0.225 euros per share in 2019 from 0.2 euros last year.\r\n\r\nLondon broker Jefferies said the dividend upgrade was good news, moving Terna more in line with the dividend policy of its European related peers.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe remain cautious regarding falling regulated investment and ventures into non-regulated businesses, especially internationally,\u201D the broker said.\r\n\r\nTerna said its new plan earmarked around 150-200 million euros to pursue international projects.

"text":"Could the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) suffer collateral damage from China\u2019s territorial claims in the South China Sea? The risk is clearly there.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe AIIB plans to make its first loan as early as the middle of this year.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s about the same time a UN arbitration tribunal in The Hague is expected to rule on the Philippines\u2019 appeal against Chinese territorial claims to virtually the entire South China Sea.\r\n\r\nShould China reject arbitration and\/or the standing of established international fora for South China Sea dispute resolution \u2014 China risks painful blow back.\r\n\r\nGiven the political cover of such precedent, AIIB borrowers could feel emboldened to renege on AIIB loan repayments. China could then find itself lacking international political support in enforcing penalties, having itself rejected respected forms of multilateral dispute resolution.\r\n\r\nFor decades, China\u2019s been the recipient of large-scale inward investment. As a result, China could write \u2014 and capriciously change \u2014 rules. But in coming years, China increasingly will be on the other side of the ledger.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s because China\u2019s multi-decade accumulation of a US$3 trillion reserve hoard is now economically destabilizing.\r\n\r\nThe AIIB was created to put this reserve hoard to work. The goal has been to maintain employment levels in China\u2019s now world-competitive infrastructure state champions.\r\n\r\nThese companies \u2014 like State Grid Corp of China and China National Overseas Oil Company (CNOOC) \u2014 are now among China\u2019s largest employers.\r\n\r\nGiven that China\u2019s internal infrastructure needs are now largely met, these state champions now need overseas contracts to avoid politically destabilizing layoffs.\r\n\r\nShifting from inward investment recipient to outward global investor represents a huge change for China. It will force a change in Chinese thinking.\r\n\r\nAt present, China believes neighboring countries either are \u2014 or should be \u2014 an extension of China, where rules are what the Communist Party says they are.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s South China Sea Nine-Dotted Line is a manifestation of this. It rests upon two retroactive fictions: undocumented assertions the line has existed \u2018since ancient times\u2019 and undocumented claims of its \u2018indisputability.\u2019\r\n\r\nGiven this, potential AIIB borrowers can\u2019t help but wonder whether similar standards may be applied in dispute resolution over AIIB loans. Could land beneath AIIB-funded, Chinese-built infrastructure in third countries be retroactively claimed \u2018indisputable\u2019 Chinese territory?\r\n\r\nAIIB borrower due diligence now must include evaluation of the above risk.\r\n\r\nAlready, China\u2019s infrastructure state champions like State Grid Corp. of China and China National Overseas Oil Company (CNOOC) \u2014 are experiencing blow back along these lines.\r\n\r\nTake Vietnam and the Philippines. Both have clearly benefited from Chinese inward investment. But both also are pushing back.\r\n\r\nVietnam now trades electricity across its border with southern China. Vietnam\u2019s also considered a potential route for the proposed $40 billion Kunming-Singapore Railway.\r\n\r\nChina and Vietnam also have agreements to cooperative manage fisheries and energy exploration in the Tonkin Gulf.\r\n\r\nBut at the same time, China\u2019s CNOOC has placed a huge oil and gas exploration rig three times in waters claimed by Vietnam, sparking anti-Chinese riots in Vietnamese cities.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s State Grid similarly has suffered blow back \u2014 in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIn 2008, State Grid won a pivotal contract to upgrade and operate the Philippine electricity grid under a 25 year contract.\r\n\r\nLast year the Philippines summarily expelled Chinese State Grid technicians and replaced them with Filipinos. The reason? Undocumented Philippine allegations of a computer virus in the grid.\r\n\r\nThese two cases \u2014 among others \u2014 illustrate the \u2018social license\u2019 and \u2018local caprice\u2019 risk China\u2019s been able to disregard during three decades of rapid internal economic growth in which it could set retroactively malleable rules.\r\n\r\nThe outside world, however, works differently.\r\n\r\nIn coming years, China must invest overseas to relieve growing internal economic imbalances and keep its populace employed to maintain political stability. This presents opportunities for borrowers and risks to China.\r\n\r\nUltimately, China\u2019s power to enforce loan repayment on stroppy host countries may be hindered by Chinese precedents in claiming such obligations to be retroactively discretionary. Translation: the strategic gaming advantage now lies with AIIB borrowers.\r\n\r\nThis should moderate Chinese behavior and lead to a greater appreciation of compromise.\r\n\r\nIn the South China Sea, Joint Development Areas offer a way to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nLook for progress along these lines in 2016."},

"text":"As the winter transfer window deadline day for the Premier League passed, Manchester City made the footballing world stand up and take notice when the club confirmed that Pep Guardiola would be taking over from current manager Manuel Pellegrini at the start of the 2016-17 season.\r\n\r\nAnother move greatly discussed but that failed to materialise was that of Brazilian attacking midfielder Alex Texeira\u2019s from Ukrainian club Shaktar Donetsk to Liverpool. The next day, the defending I-league champions Mohun Bagan lost their AFC Champions League qualification match by a margin of six goals. Apart from football, what was the other major factor connecting these three events? China.\r\n\r\nUntitled-1 copyUntitled-1 copy\r\n\r\nWhile Bagan lost to Shandong Luneng, third in the 2015 Chinese Super League (CSL), the 26-year-old Texeira moved to Jiangsu Suning, ninth in the league last season, for a sum of 50 million euros. But Suning\u2019s new-found riches, after being acquired by the Suning commerce Group in December 2015, has seen it smash the Chinese transfer record twice during the window with Brazilian midfielder Ramires also signing for the club from Chelsea for a reported sum of 28 million euros.\r\n\r\nShandong Luneng, on the other hand, are owned by the Shandong Electric Power Group, a subsidiary of the State Grid Corporation of China. Like Luneng and Suning, most CSL clubs are owned or controlled by state-backed corporations or realestate companies.\r\n\r\nThe other team to break the Chinese transfer record during this window, Guangzhou Evergrande, have a story which runs parallel to the rise to CSL itself. Relegated in 2009 after a matchfixing scandal which rocked Chinese football, they were bought over by the Evergrande Real Estate Group, which pumped in funds overseeing the club winning five consecutive domestic titles from 2011 to 2015 and the AFC Champions League in 2013 and 2015.\r\n\r\nGuangzhou spent heavy money in this period recruiting players as well as managers. Among the last three men to take charge of the first team have been World Cup winning managers, Marcelo Lippi and Luiz Felipe Scolari as well as a World Cup winning captain, Fabio Cannavaro.\r\n\r\nThe other majority stakeholders in Guangzhou are Jack Ma\u2019s Alibaba Group, which owns 40%. With the government wanting to see sports grow as a significant contributor to the GDP in the wake of an otherwise slowing economy along with President Xi Jinping\u2019s personal interest in the game, investment in football is seen as a politically smart move and a good business opportunity making football a more lucrative asset class by the day.\r\n\r\nOn December 1, 2015, shortly after Xi\u2019s visit to Manchester City in October, a consortium led by China Media Capital (CMC) and CITIC Group, which also controls the CSL club Beijing Guoan, bought a 13% stake in City Football Group for $400 million. This was the latest in a series of high-profile Chinese investments in other European clubs, the others including Atletico Madrid, Sochaux, Ado Den Haag and Malaga. CMC also recently clinched the global broadcast rights of the CSL over the next five years for $1.3 billion, a 20-fold increase on the previous deal.\r\n\r\nAfter the match-fixing scandal, an overall reform plan had been announced in March 2015 by the State Council General Office. The Football Association would have no administrative ranks inside and the number of elementary and middle schools featuring football would increase to 20,000 by 2020 and 50,000 by 2025.\r\n\r\nPlans with long-term goals of bidding for hosting the World Cup and bettering the standards of the national team with the ultimate aim of winning the World Cup were also set in motion. The national team, which last played in the 2002 World Cup, and ranking 93 on the Fifa list, won all their group stage matches in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup before eventually losing to hosts and eventual champions Australia.\r\n\r\nWhile comparisons with the recruitment policies of the MLS and the ISL cannot be helped, there are three significant factors that make the CSL differ from these two emerging leagues. The average age of foreign recruits is far less \u2014 which means the players are not totally past their prime and are far more competitive. There are only five slots for foreign players with one of those slots for a player from an AFC country and the goalkeepers have to be Chinese, thus aiding the development of young Chinese talent and their ability to pay astronomical salaries to the foreigners means that only a handful of European clubs have the financial might to match the Chinese clubs.\r\n\r\nQuestions still remain about the outcome of this newly found momentum that Chinese football has gathered. Will there be a discernible improvement in the national team five years from now? Will there be new calls for further reform? Separately, once Xi Jinping retires, will that have any bearing on the current push for reform? Will his successor embrace these changes as much? But for now, Chinese football enjoys its moment in the sun."}]},

Nine members of top management are retiring following a series of quality issues.\r\n\r\nSeiji Kuraishi, head of Honda\u2019s China business, becomes executive vice president and Hachigo\u2019s No. 2 executive, a company statement said. Kuraishi, 57, replaces Tetsuo Iwamura, who is retiring along with Chairman Fumihiko Ike and seven others.\r\n\r\nHachigo is forming a new lineup of direct reports one year after the nation\u2019s third-largest automaker tapped him to succeed Takanobu Ito amid struggles with unprecedented quality issues. Honda is recalling thousands of 2016 Civic cars, months after introducing the most crucial redesigned model under Hachigo, because manufacturing errors could lead to engine failures. Honda also is the biggest client of Takata, whose air bag inflators are responsible for the industry\u2019s biggest safety recall ever.\r\n\r\n\u201CTheir quality problem is still going on,\u201D Koji Endo, an analyst with Advanced Research Japan, said by phone before Honda announced the management changes. \u201CIt\u2019s not just one person\u2019s responsibility; it\u2019s the responsibility of the whole organization. I don\u2019t know if just switching the top can solve all the problems.\u201D\r\n\r\nYoshiyuki Matsumoto, the chief operating officer for auto operations, will become president of Honda\u2019s research and development unit, replacing Koichi Fukuo, who is retiring.\r\n\r\nHonda R&D is significant because all previous chiefs before Hachigo, 56, had run it before becoming CEO.\r\n\r\nSince 2008, Honda has issued recalls to replace about 30 million Takata inflators, which can rupture and spray metal and plastic shards at occupants. The inflators have been linked to nine fatalities in Honda models; a 10th incident is being investigated.\r\n\r\nHonda detailed the Civic recall in a statement Tuesday from its U.S. unit. It is calling back 42,000 cars with 2-liter engines after learning of an engine fire and another unconfirmed injury report related to poorly assembled engine pistons.\r\n\r\nThe Civic recall is a setback for a redesigned model that has been winning acclaim, including the North American Car of the Year award, handed out in January by a committee of automotive journalists.\r\n\r\nHachigo rose to president last year after starting his career as an engineer for core models within Honda\u2019s lineup \u2014 the Odyssey minivan and CR-V sport utility vehicle. He later worked in executive roles in the U.S., Europe, and China, and is promoting several members of management from the latter market.\r\n\r\nYasuhide Mizuno, head of a joint venture with Guangzhou Automobile Group, will succeed Kuraishi to lead the China operations. Asako Suzuki, chief of the JV with Dongfeng Motor Corp., will become Honda\u2019s first female operating officer.\r\n\r\nThe promotions for three top executives in China follow its topping 1 million vehicles sold in the world\u2019s largest market for the first time last year.\r\n\r\nToshiaki Mikoshiba, head of Honda\u2019s Europe operations, will take charge of North America.

"text":"Honda Motor (hmc, +0.51%) is expanding its recall in North America of late-model vehicles equipped with potentially defective Takata airbags, adding 2.23 million vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese automaker said certain Acura and Honda vehicles from model years 2005-2016 are being recalled to replace Takata PSDI-5 driver-side inflators.\r\n\r\nIt recalled another 269,000 similar models in Canada on Monday for the same issue.\r\n\r\nTakata Corp told U.S. safety regulators two weeks ago that about 3.9 million PSDI-5 inflators sold to several different vehicle manufacturers could rupture and kill, or cause serious injury to vehicle occupants. Honda\u2019s latest recall is included in that count.\r\n\r\nThe company said on Wednesday no PSDI-5 ruptures had been reported in its vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe Japanese automaker also said it was recalling 341,000 Accords due to a separate issue affecting the electronic control unit used in supplemental restraint systems in 2008-2010 models, which could result in airbags failing to deploy.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Honda\u2019s U.S. unit confirmed it had instructed U.S. dealers to stop selling some of its new model Civics equipped with 2.0 liter base engines. The Accord and Civic are Honda\u2019s best-selling models in the United States, placed at fifth and sixth, respectively, in sales in 2015.\r\n\r\nHonda declined to comment on U.S. media reports that the order and a related recall notice were issued for around 34,000 new Civics, which have been selling briskly since U.S. sales began in November, due to a manufacturing issue which may cause engine damage or failure.\r\nHonda and Volvo Named North American Car and Truck of the Year\r\nWatch from the North American International Auto Show.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nAirbag Recalls Set to Continue\r\n\r\nDefective Takata inflators have been linked to nine U.S. deaths since 2004, all but one of them in older Honda vehicles.\r\n\r\nHonda previously has recalled more than 6 million U.S. vehicles since 2008 to replace defective Takata inflators.\r\n\r\nHonda said the PSDI-5 inflators will be replaced, beginning this summer, with parts from another supplier.\r\n\r\nIts latest action indicates the continuing Takata recalls may not be over.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, Democratic U.S. senators Richard Blumenthal and Edward Markey urged NHTSA to recall all cars with Takata inflators. The senators estimated that 24 million such vehicles remained on U.S. roads.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, Democratic Senator Bill Nelson said \u201Cthe never-ending flow of piecemeal recall announcements\u201D on Takata airbags \u201Cneeds to end\u201D.\r\n\r\nAsked about a broader recall, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told reporters on Tuesday that NHTSA\u2019s investigation \u201Chas not been closed.

Many of these vehicles are also top sellers in their respective categories, suggesting the automaker's efforts are working to grow Honda's visibility and reach in today's highly-competitive new-car market. And while Honda's overall sales were up modestly (2.6 percent) in 2015, at Kelley Blue Book we tracked the brand's transaction price growth at 2.7 percent. That's higher than Chevrolet , Kia, Subaru or Toyota (and essentially tied with Mazda's 2.8 percent price growth), suggesting the appeal of these new products is creating strong demand.\r\nHonda Civic Coupe Rear\r\n\r\nPhoto courtesy American Honda Motor Company\r\n\r\nDon't expect the product parade to slow down. Beyond the upcoming Ridgeline truck and Odyssey minivan makeovers there's the small matter of Honda's small car, the Civic. This model has generated big sales numbers for decades, and the latest version, all-new for 2016, will come in more forms than any Civic before it. We've already discussed the sedan version, which hit showrooms last fall and is now leading the compact car segment in sales. The 2016 Civic sedan is a massive leap forward, essentially redefining the small car with regard to quality, refinement and advanced technology. In fact it was good enough to win 2016 North American Car of Year. Now comes the 2016 Honda Civic Coupe, featuring all the same goodness in a sportier package.\r\n\r\nHonda Civic Coupe Profile\r\n\r\nPhoto courtesy American Honda Motor Company\r\n\r\nHonda's representatives told us the Civic Coupe is the style and design lead for the Civic line. Compared to the sedan the coupe appeals to a younger, more active and more educated demographic. It's also more likely to feed into larger Honda models by generating higher brand loyalty. The expressive exterior design language is clear at first glance, with the Civic Coupe having a 1.2-inch longer wheelbase, 1.2-inch shorter front overhang and 5.4-inch shorter rear overhang versus the new sedan. The roof is also 0.8 inches lower, and with the standard 16-inch alloy wheels on a base LX trim (17-inch wheels are standard on EX and Touring trims) the Civic Coupe imparts a low and wide stance.\r\nHonda Civic Coupe Rear Driving\r\n\r\nPhoto courtesy American Honda Motor Company\r\n\r\nLike the sedan the Civic Coupe features two engine and transmission choices. The base 2.0-liter, naturally-aspirated four-cylinder produces 158 horsepower and 138 pound-feet of torque while delivering 30 city mpg, 41 highway mpg and 34 combined mpg. Those are class-leading fuel efficiency numbers, though horsepower and torque is lower than some competitors. Does this mean Civic Coupes with the base 2.0-liter feels underpowered? Not in the least. First, the normally-aspirated engine provides excellent low-end torque, and the power delivery through Honda's continuously-variable transmission (CVT) is as good as any CVT on the market. Even better is the available (and highly engaging) 6-speed manual with this engine. Trust us, if you \"settle\" for a 2.0-liter version of the Civic Coupe you aren't really settling."},

That, plus growing concerns about a slowdown, or even a recession, in China, led to fears that the current growth cycle for autos might be coming to an end.\r\n\r\nHonda is also suffering from the high costs of a series of huge recalls related to defective airbag inflators from longtime supplier Takata. The company has already recalled nearly 25 million vehicles around the world, and the recalls are expected to take a roughly $2.6 billion bite out of its earnings for fiscal 2016.\r\n\r\nNow what: Honda's shares have been slumping for much of the last two years. That's only partly because of the Takata recalls: Honda has also been fending off concerns about its sluggish efforts in China and its so-so sales gains here in the United States. \r\n\r\nStill, I'd hesitate to call Honda a buy even at current prices. Its dividend yield is still a relatively meager 2.64%, and its own expectations for sales and profit growth are modest.

Dividends per share have been volatile since 2011, generally falling in absolute terms when compared to insurance industry averages.\r\nDividend Policy\r\n\r\nChina Life paid one dividend a year, every year between 2006 and 2015. The first three of these dividends, from 2006 to 2008, were paid in July. Between 2009 and 2015, dividend payments occurred in August, although they rotated between the first and fourth weeks of the month. The dividend for 2015 was payable on Aug. 21; the dividend was declared June 8, just two weeks before a 3:1 split was announced.\r\n\r\nDividends per share declined by more than 60% between 2010 and 2012 but swiftly rebounded from 18 cents to 32 cents in 2015. Dividends were slightly down over five years, although growth was strong over three years. This trendline matches up with earnings per share (EPS), which declined from $4.40 in 2010 to just $1.95 in 2012, but an impressive 131.8% EPS growth from 2013 to 2014 brought EPS back to $5.70.\r\n\r\nDividends and yields both grew strongly between 2013 and 2015, both very positive indicators for shareholders. Yield climbed from 0.78% in 2012 to 2.84% in 2014 and 2.64% in 2015, although early expectations for 2016 suggest a 0.84% dividend yield. Lower expectations are based on poor return on equity (ROE) in 2015, as well as below-industry-average return on assets (ROA) and return on capital (ROC). Many expect a cooling off from strong earnings growth over a trailing three-year period.\r\nDividend Coverage and Payout Ratios\r\n\r\nDuring 2015, LFC had a relatively low dividend payout ratio at 29%. This means a full 71% of earnings were retained by China Life. In a sense, this is a positive for the company because it displays the ability to reinvest and grow, but it also raises red flags because insurance is not a capital-intensive industry. Shareholders might not be getting enough value for their investments.\r\n\r\nThe company's dividend coverage ratio tells the same story. Dividends for LFC are extremely well covered by net profit at 3.4x coverage; the company could conceivably triple its dividend payout without having to expand future earnings. This signals the potential for growth, but frustrated shareholders might feel they are not receiving their dues. Expect future payout to shareholders to increase; even Chinese companies struggle to maintain 70% net earnings retention and a 3.0x or more coverage ratio.\r\nBalance Sheet Review\r\n\r\nCash on hand for LFC still trails 2012 totals, while current liabilities increased nearly 80% over that period. As is common with financial firms, the market capitalization of LFC is several times higher than the market value of its real assets. Even still, LFC trades at significantly higher multiples than the insurance industry average. On a positive note, there was significant revenue growth over the last two quarters of 2015.\r\n\r\nA balance sheet review is critical for putting dividend performance in context, but it is more difficult to get good data for Chinese companies than for domestic companies. Part of the reason is the stringent restrictions placed on foreign investments in the Chinese stock market, which means Chinese companies are less incentivized to offer useful information to American investors. Additionally, a lot of information comes from nonreputable and poorly translated sources, making it tricky to trust public information.\r\n\r\nInterested investors should focus on reliable databases, such as Morningstar, Barron's, Bloomberg and even Yahoo Finance. Good information can also be found through \"H-share\" class stocks, which are Chinese companies that trade on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, or \"N-share\" class stocks trading on the NYSE and NASDAQ.\r\nCredit Suisse Upgrades China Life Ratings\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 27, 2015, directly in the heart of the initial Chinese stock market collapse, multinational brokerage firm Credit Suisse upgraded two of China's top companies: CNOOC Ltd. and China Life. Each company improved to an outperform rating, although the China Life boost was more substantial because its prior rating was underperform. The move signaled a 50% upside potential for the stock going forward.\r\n\r\nThe news followed healthy value growth according to Credit Suisse metrics and a \"strong solvency position.\" The latter factor should be crucial for dividend investors; companies battling debt concerns are less likely to pay or raise dividends in the future. Another reason for the move was the role of the Chinese government, which bought stocks directly in the wake of the country's equity crisis in order to prop up asset values. Proactive governments may receive mixed reviews from economists, but shareholders generally love them if government involvement favors their investments.\r\nChallenges in China\r\n\r\nThe Chinese stock market was in a shambles between August 2015 and February 2016. Nearly every major asset class, especially equities and real estate, grew unchecked for the five preceding years. This volatility did not really affect the LFC share price. LFC fell from a high around $25 per share in June 2015 to $15 per share in August 2015, but that was primarily because of a stock split. Share prices actually grew throughout the Chinese stock market crash and into November.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for LFC stockholders, appreciation did not last. From November 2015 to the end of January 2016, LFC fell from $18.30 to $11.97. Naturally, yield grew from 1.69% to 2.64% over the same period. Fortunately for China Life, the challenges in the Chinese market do not appear to inhibit its earnings projections or future dividend payments as much as many of its contemporaries.\r\nMajor Competitors\r\n\r\nChina Life competes on a global scale, although its primary rivals in the Asian insurance markets are China Pacific Insurance Group Co. Ltd., PICC Property & Casualty Co. Ltd., and Ping An Insurance Company of China, Ltd. LFC has much greater annual revenue than either China Pacific or PICC, but Ping An Insurance generated more revenue in 2015; the same rankings hold true in terms of net income and EPS.\r\n\r\nIn terms of dividends per share, however, LFC is much more generous to stockholders. For example, Ping An Insurance paid four dividends between June 2014 and September 2015 of between 2.8 cents per share and 7.2 cents per share, less than one-third LFC's average. Among international competitors in 2015, LFC's dividends were comparable to ING Group, which paid dividends of 13 cents and 26 cents."},

"text":"With foreign insurers such as ING Life scheduled to be sold off one after another as early as in the first half of this year, it is expected that Chinese insurers will additionally make a foray into the Korean market. According to the insurance industry, war will be waged to take over ING Life, Allianz Life and PCA Life among foreign life insurers doing business in Korea.\r\n\r\nEarlier, MBK Partners promised the Financial Supervisory Commission not to sell ING Life within two years when the company took over 100 percent equities in the life insurer at 1,840 billion won. The two years have already passed. MBK Partners is planning to sell off the company by putting it on the market as early as in the first half of this year.\r\n\r\nING Life has focused on the management of its corporate value in consideration of its resale over the past two years. Its operating income rose 18 percent to 300.3 billion won in 2014 from 253.7 billion won in 2013. The \u201CBrave Orange Whole Life Insurance (nonparticipating)\u201D became a big hit product last year. Thus the company\u2019s operating income in 2015 is expected to increase further.   \r\n\r\nAllianz Life and PCA Life are expected to withdraw from the Korean market and execute processes to sell off their Korean branches. The two are failing to record strong profitability in the Korean market although they entered the Korean market more than ten years ago. Analysts say that the introduction of the second phase of the IFRS4, a new accounting standard in 2020 calls for capital increases, leading them to think that maintaining their operation in Korea may become burdens.\r\n\r\nGermany\u2019s Allianz Group advanced into Korea by taking over Jeil Life Insurance in 1999. It has been said that Allianz Life is an old organization as the company has an old corporate culture even though the company made a foray into the Korean life insurance 17 years ago. The value of its net assets in 2014 is estimated at one trillion won.  \r\n\r\nPCA Life began its business in Korea as the Prudential Group of the UK took over Youngpoong Life in 2001. They decided to pull out of Korea in 16 years. It is said that PCA Life began to contact potential buyers on a full scale with Morgan Stanley as a lead manager. \r\n\r\nThe Korea Development Bank (KDB) began to take steps for the resale of KDB Life as the funds will mature on February 4 in 2017. In the first place, the KDB attempted a package deal of KDB Life and KDB Daewoo Securities, private equity funds own some equities and a difference among opinions thwarted the plan.    \r\n\r\nIn the insurance industry, it is said that China-based insurance companies will show their power in competition to take over these companies. It is known that Chinese capital such as Ping An Insurance of China is having an eye on taking over Allianz Life.  \r\n\r\nOf late, Chinese insurers have been actively knocking on the door to the Korean financial market with rich cash assets. Earlier, Anbang Insurance of China signaled its entry into the Korean financial market while taking over Tong Yang Life. The Korean financial market is relatively stable compared to other newly emerging markets and low interest rates keep fund raising cost low.\r\n\r\nMany analysts said that Chinese insurance are doing so as they are confident that they will sell many savings-linked insurances and use the outcomes in asset management. In the case of Tong Yang Life, the company has reached 300 billion won by selling many single payment savings-linked insurance policies in order to expand its assets in a short period since January.   \r\n\r\nBesides, Korea is geographically close to China, which is another attractive point for Chinese insurance companies. \u201CMany M&As are scheduled to take place this year. So some people call 2016 \u2018a year of M&As\u2019 in the insurance market,\u201D an insurance market expert said. \u201CMuch attention is paid to the activities of Chinese insurance companies with big capital.\u201D\r\n"},

"text":"Chinese netizens exchanged an incredible eight billion virtual red envelopes on Tecent\u2019s WeChat mobile messaging platform while ushering in the Year of the Monkey.\r\n\r\nThe eight-fold increase in the number of red envelopes \u2013 a gift of money - sent via WeChat since 2014 underscores the explosive growth of internet finance in the world\u2019s most populous nation. Less than three years after Alibaba (BABA) launched its online wealth management platform Yu\u2019ebao, China\u2019s internet finance industry has mushroomed into a multi-trillion dollar business. But there\u2019s still plenty of room for growth.\r\nBillionaire Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group.\r\nBillionaire Jack Ma, chairman of Alibaba Group. Bloomberg News\r\n\r\nAnalysts expect the three key segments of online payments, peer-to-peer lending and online wealth management, to grow between 30% and 60% annually over the next three years. The ability to gain new users easily and cheaply, combined with lower competition from non-internet finance providers and the launch of innovative new online-to-offline products, could see China\u2019s leading Internet finance providers \u201Ceclipse their U.S. peers on many fronts,\u201D argues Credit Suisse. The broker argues valuations could increase to levels on par or even higher than those of leading U.S. online finance stocks, which trade at considerably richer multiples.\r\n\r\nCredit Suisse\u2019s top picks are Internet giants Alibaba and Tencent (700.HK), as well as Ping An Insurance (2318.HK), given their strengths in key parts of the internet finance industry. The broker likes the companies\u2019 product innovation and how the growth of their networks is a magnet for other users to join up. Credit Suisse recently lifted its price targets on Alibaba and Tencent on a more meaningful contribution to valuations from their internet finance businesses.\r\n\r\nOnline payments are the most mature segment of China\u2019s internet finance industry, tracing its origins back to the launch of Alibaba\u2019s Alipay in 2004. Alibaba\u2019s head start has allowed it to dominate the CNY21 trillion online payments industry with a 58% market share, eclipsing the 20% stake held by closest rival Tencent\u2019s Tenpay. However, Tencent has been gaining ground despite lacking the customer base Alibaba enjoys through its e-commerce platform. Tencent has been tapping into WeChat\u2019s 650 million users to create \u201Cnew payment scenarios\u201D such as mobile games, online-to-offline (O2O) payments and red packet transactions. Credit Suisse expects Tencent to have a 25% share of online payments by 2018, although Alibaba would remain the market leader with 59% share. The size of the online payments market is forecast to reach CNY23.5 trillion for personal computers and CNY28.9 trillion for mobile by 2018, which imply annual growth rates of 31% and 48%.\r\nChinese Stocks Cashing in on Internet Finance Boom\r\n\r\nInternet banks go hand-in-hand with online payments, and both Alibaba and Tencent have opened virtual bank outlets, where users can open term deposits and take out loans. Tencent led the way in 2014 with WeBank, which offers personal, corporate and international banking. The company put its data mining capacity to work in its first WeBank product, a micro lending service called Weilidai. Loans do not require collateral or guarantees provided the borrower makes it onto a \u2018white list\u2019 put together by the WeBank and WeChat teams. Weilidai has more than 20 million white list users, 660,000 active borrowers and a loan balance of CNY7.5 billion. Alibaba\u2019s MyBank also focuses on micro lending, but tends to take on greater credit risk than WeBank as it lends money from its own balance sheet rather than act as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders.\r\n\r\nWealth management is also shifting increasingly online. The segment is expected to grow at a 30% annual pace and could have CNY38.5 trillion of assets under management by 2018. Online accounts for only 3% of the Chinese wealth management market, but the proportion will increase thanks to China\u2019s more technologically savvy young generation. Credit Suisse says the BATs \u2013 or China\u2019s three Internet giants of Baidu (BIDU), Alibaba and Tencent \u2013 have an advantage in capturing this growth given their \u201Clong-term accumulation of customer resources and platform advantage,\u201D as well as big data and mobile capabilities.\r\n\r\nCredit Suisse analyst Dick Wei values Tencent\u2019s internet finance business at $29.3 billion, which breaks down to HKD24.50 a share, based on a 2018 estimated earnings multiple of 20 times. In comparison, U.S. online payments company PayPal (PYPL) trades at 17 times 2018 earnings. Others drivers for Tencent shares could include better-than-expected monetization of social media platforms and mobile games sales. Wei rates Tencent as outperform with an HKD176 a share price target, which is 26% above its current price of HKD140 a share.\r\n\r\nWei calculates Alibaba\u2019s internet finance unit, Ant Financial, is worth roughly $59 billion by applying a multiple of 20 times estimated 2018 earnings. Around 80% of the valuation relates to Alipay. The analyst values the e-commerce giant\u2019s core business at $88.4 a share and has an outperform rating on Alibaba with a $96 a share price target, which implies 43% upside. Currently fetching $67 a share, Alibaba trades at 20 times forward earnings, which makes it the cheapest of the BATs. Alibaba shares have fallen 22% over the past year compared to a 9% rise for Tencent shares.\r\n\r\nWhile online payment has the longest history among segments of China\u2019s Internet finance industry, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has attracted the most controversy. Besides a spate of bankruptcies, last year, a popular P2P lending platform called Ezubo scammed more than CNY50 billion from mom and pop investors. However, Beijing is now clamping down after years of unregulated growth. The arrival of tougher regulations is expected to spur market consolidation and the growth of P2P platforms backed by leading financial services companies. Lufax, a P2P platform backed by insurer Ping An, is seen to be well positioned to profit from a market expected to grow at a 61% annual pace to be worth CNY1.8 trillion market by 2018.\r\n\r\nLufax\u2019s share of the P2P market is expected to double to 16% by 2018. Like Tencent\u2019s Weilidai, Lufax manages risk by crunching big data sourced from credit agencies and Ping An\u2019s database of insurance clients.\r\n\r\nLufax\u2019s largest shareholder is Ping An, which has a 44% stake. Currently at around HKD33 a share, Ping An is down 47% from its peak last June and trades at 1.5 times book value, which is near a five-year low. Besides Lufax, Ping An also has exposure to Internet finance through ZhongAn Insurance, a joint venture with Alibaba and Tencent that is the first Chinese property insurance company to sell all of its products online.

Following the government\u2019s deregulation last year, insurance companies have churned out investments to meet the growing demand safer, but slower savings vehicles \u2013 leveraging their ability to package together products with guaranteed yields of up to 3.5 per cent.\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s insurance sector premium income grew by 20 per cent in 2015, bringing in 2.4 trillion yuan (HK$2.9 trillion) according to figures from the China Insurance Regulatory Commission, the industry supervisor.\r\n\r\nThe personal life insurance sub sector recorded a 25 per cent year-on-year gain in premium income, outperformed the property and casualty sub sector, which grew by 11 per cent year on year.\r\n\r\nDayton Wang, an analyst with Guotai Junan International recommends Ping An Insurance, a company dual listed in Hong Kong and Shanghai as his top pick in the sector.\r\n\r\n\u201CPing An\u2019s investment capabilities make it less sensitive to investment performance than peer listed life insurers, which has been under pressure amid China\u2019s dropping bond yields and a gloomy global capital market,\u201D said Wang. \u201CMeanwhile, the expected initial public offering of Lufax, a peer to peer lending platform under the group may help lift the company\u2019s valuation.\u201D\r\n\r\nWang has a target price of HK$49.90 for the insurer\u2019s Hong Kong-listed shares.\r\n\r\nAnalysts from Bank of China International also gave Ping An\u2019s A shares a \u201Cbuy\u201D rating in early February.\r\n\r\n\u201CPing An\u2019s strengths in comprehensive financial services and internet technology will create more internal synergies while improving the company\u2019s resilience against market volatilities,\u201D they wrote in a note, giving the insurer\u2019s Shanghai-listed shares a price target of 45.32 yuan.\r\n\r\nSimilar to it peers, Ping An has been aggressive in signing up new policy holders, according to its January premiums, Credit Suisse said in a research note on Monday. Credit Suisse has an \u201Coutperform\u201D rating on Ping An\u2019s Hong Kong listed shares and a target price of HK$65.\r\n\r\nPremiums from the life sector jumped 41 per cent r on year, compared to 6 per cent on year growth in the property and casualty sector.\r\n\r\nHowever, analysts advise investors to be wary of potential changes in the operating environment.\r\n\r\nJP Morgan analysts highlighted concerns of a potential price war among the non life sector, saying it was a potential negative that could drag down those companies that underwrite for a broader sector of the economy.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe non-life market is expected to face underwriting margin compression (auto premium cuts) for the next two to three years. Also, we see limited underwriting margin improvement potential for non-auto insurance considering a weak economic growth outlook, high competition, and more capital injection from new players,\u201D JP Morgan said in a January report.\r\n\r\nJP Morgan also warned against insurers\u2019 ambition for creating the bank-insurance hybrid business model, through aggressive acquisition of banks\u2019 stakes.\r\n\r\n\u201CRaising banking ownership for Chinese insurers with less sufficient shareholders\u2019 funds and\/or relatively short duration policyholders\u2019 funds should increase the risk profile for insurers.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe analysts said they were concerned about People\u2019s Insurance Company of China (PICC) Group\u2019s recent purchase of the stake in Hua Xia Bank and an extra stake increase in Industrial Bank.They added that they prefer Ping An Group with a business streamlining outlook in its noncore non-insurance business including peer to peer lending, trust fund and banking.\r\n\r\nIn late December, PICC Property and Casualty, a subsidiary of PICC Group, announced it had acquired a 20 per cent stake in Chinese mid-sized lender Huaxia Bank from Deutsche Bank AG for 25.7 billion yuan.\r\n\r\nEarlier in mid July, the PICC Group announced it had bought a 3.19 per cent stake in Industrial Bank for 10.1 billion yuan.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, PICC Group announced that its life premiums in January surged 110 per cent year on year to 48.6 billion yuan, while health premiums increased by 88 per cent year on year.

It said the charity received about \u00A341 from E.ON for every person it signed up to the deal, totalling \u00A36m a year. The energy secretary, Amber Rudd, asked the watchdog Ofgem to launch an urgent inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe Sun said it found details of E.ON payments to the charity within Age UK\u2019s annual accounts.\r\n\r\nIn a joint statement, German-owned E.ON and Age UK said: \u201CE.ON and Age UK Enterprises have announced that they are temporarily to stop offering an Age UK Enterprises branded tariff to new and renewing E.ON customers from Wednesday 10 February 2016. This decision has been reached on a mutual basis and both organisations retain confidence in the tariff offered to customers. However, due to continued speculation regarding the partnership, both organisations feel it is right to pause and reflect on the best way for both parties to achieve their shared goal of helping customers.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe statement said E.ON customers on other Age UK Enterprises tariffs were unaffected by this move and would be able to continue until their contract expires or move without penalty between tariffs at any point.

Eight Age UK executives involved in the commercial side of the charity earn more than \u00A3100,000 a year, with 47 people at the charity collecting more than \u00A360,000.\r\nE.ON and Age UK urged to refund pensioners over fuel deal\r\nRead more\r\n\r\nHowever, Jeffrey said Age UK had done nothing wrong. \u201CA person would feel the need to apologise if they had done something wrong, we are clear we haven\u2019t done anything wrong,\u201D she said. \u201CThe only thing I would apologise for is the upset to our staff, our volunteers, and for those people who rely on us for information and advice.\u201D\r\n\r\nJeffrey said that media coverage of the charity\u2019s commercial operations had been \u201Cconfused and confusing\u201D.\r\n\r\nShe added: \u201CAs with all these things it is bound to have resonated with the public and of course that is very sad, but you know it has helped to showcase the great deals that Age UK has, and it has made charities very defiant and resilient. I hope confidence begins to rebuild very soon.\r\n\r\n\u201COur indication is that very few people have cancelled or called up to say, \u2018What is going on?\u2019 When reporting is getting exaggerated or is scurrilous, people realise that and move on, and we are hoping that people move on.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are clear that accusations are misleading, unfair and not right, and that will come across in the next few weeks.\u201D\r\nThe Charities Act: what you need to know\r\nRead more\r\n\r\nJeffrey, a former NHS trust chairwoman and the deputy chancellor of the University of Derby, made the comments despite MPs and campaign groups lambasting the Age UK and E.ON tie-up and calling for customers to be refunded.\r\n\r\nShe said criticism of the partnership had focused on price to the detriment of other benefits.\r\n\r\n\u201COur customers don\u2019t say price is the be all and end all \u2013 it is quality of service, aftercare, terms and conditions, and special conditions. So even if charity trading arms can\u2019t be the cheapest, they can make sure it is best for customers, which we do,\u201D she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think it was the best deal for our customers. People will have saved considerably more than if they had been on standard variable package, and furthermore they could switch for free of charge, and have alerts from E.ON on other deals.\u201D\r\n\r\nJeffrey, who said she is on the two-year fixed tariff deal, said: \u201CIt represented a very good and outstanding deal for customers.\u201D\r\n\r\nAge UK launched the product in December 2013 with a \u201Cmarket leading rate\u201D and has monitored prices across the industry every month since then, she added. There were two price cuts to the tariff since its launch.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, Age UK and E.ON announced they were postponing the promotion this week, although Jeffery insisted the timing was not linked to the criticism the charity has faced.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe deal was due to come to an end last Tuesday [9 February] and E.ON informed us they can no longer offer us a two-year fixed tariff for customers and they were increasing the price for one year, so we decided it was no longer market leading and reasonable,\u201D she said. \u201CI feel sad that elderly people now can\u2019t get that deal that Age UK had negotiated for them.\u201D\r\n\r\nJeffrey also claimed that critics do not understand how Age UK\u2019s commercial arm works. Age UK Enterprises operates separately from the charity and its offers are therefore not subsidised by Age UK, she said. Instead, Age UK Enterprises subsidises Age UK, with the profits it raises invested into charitable causes.\r\n\r\nHowever, there has been unease at the scale of Age UK\u2019s commercial operations. Five years ago a collection of local Age Concern charities split from Age UK over concerns about commercial arrangements it wanted to impose on them.\r\n\r\nJeffrey said she was proud that Age UK was ahead of other charities in generating funds from alternative sources.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe government has called on charities to be more business-like so they are not reliant on hand outs and donations,\u201D she said. \u201CIt is important to have a variety of income streams to make sure the charity does not run out of money.\u201D\r\n\r\nBut Age UK spends a significant amount to generate the commercial income. The accounts of Age UK Enterprises show that while it generated \u00A348m in revenue last year, it handed over just \u00A38m in profits to Age UK. Its costs included more than \u00A35m in wages for just over 170 staff.\r\n\r\nJeffrey defended the salaries at Age UK, saying: \u201CNobody who works solely for the charity earns more than six figures. It is different in the trading arm, because it needs to make a profit and we need people with expertise. We need to pay the going rate to keep good people on board.\u201D\r\n\r\nJeffrey added that Age UK was not planning to make changes. \u201CObviously we will be looking to see if we can improve things and what we can do better, but off the top of my head I can\u2019t think there is anything we would change without deep consideration,\u201D she said.\r\n"},

"text":"The Sun newspaper said energy deals offered by Age UK with supplier E.On may have been much more expensive than the cheapest offers from the firm.\r\n\r\nThe energy regulator Ofgem and the Charities Commission are to examine the deals.\r\n\r\nAge UK rejected the allegations, while E.On said its tariffs were competitive.\r\n\r\nIn return for selling its energy deals, the Sun alleged that Age UK had received about \u00A36m from E.On.\r\n'Generous'\r\n\r\nThe Sun claimed that Age UK recommended a special rate from E.On which would typically cost pensioners \u00A31,049 for the year - \u00A3245 more than its cheapest rate in 2015.\r\n\r\nIt also alleged that Age UK received about \u00A341 from energy supplier E.On for every person signed up.\r\n\r\nAge UK's accounts indeed show that it received \u00A36.3m in income from energy deals in the year to April 2015.\r\n\r\nBut the charity said the commission was typically only \u00A310 per customer.\r\n\r\n\"We strongly reject the allegations and interpretation of figures,\" said a spokesperson for Age UK.\r\nImage copyright E.On\r\nImage caption E.On's website appears to show that its one year tariff is \u00A3176 cheaper than the Age UK deal\r\nSwitching option\r\n\r\nThe charity said its two year fixed tariff was the cheapest deal on offer when it launched in January. It said customers were free to choose the one-year option, but many preferred the reassurance of a two-year tariff.\r\n\r\nE.On said the Sun had made a comparison between two different types of tariffs.\r\n\r\nThe Age UK two year tariff has no exit fees. According to E.On's website, this deal should currently cost an average user \u00A3948 a year.\r\n\r\nE.On's one year fixed tariff, which has a \u00A360 exit fee, should cost \u00A3772 - \u00A3176 cheaper.\r\nImage copyright Age UK\r\nAnalysis: Simon Gompertz, BBC Personal Finance Correspondent\r\n\r\nLike any charity, Age UK needs cash to fund its charitable work. But by delving into the cut-throat business of selling gas and electricity, it has exposed itself to embarrassing criticism.\r\n\r\nIts two-year fixed rates may have looked like good deals when they were launched. But once cheaper offers appeared, customers were bound to start complaining that a charity should have been making sure they were paying as little as possible.\r\n\r\nAnd should it be earning millions of pounds in commission? Well, price comparison websites do. However, the fact that Age UK was receiving the money will have come as a surprise to some of the older people who were relying on its recommendations.\r\n\r\nIn the end, Age UK and E.On's energy offer raises the question of how we want our charities to be raising funds in these difficult times when donations are hard to come by.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you become a sales operation, there is a danger that people will say you are putting profit before charity.\r\n'Rough deal'\r\n\r\n73 year-old Beth Porter, from Frant in Kent, now regrets taking out the two-year fixed deal with Age UK.\r\n\r\n\"Sadly, I too, fell for this so-called good deal for pensioners,\" she told the BBC.\r\n\r\n\"As a pensioner of fixed income, I really cannot afford to receive notice of my latest dual fuel bill and find it was double what I've usually been paying.\"\r\n\r\nE.On said: \"Our current Age UK tariff was the UK's cheapest product of its type in the UK when it was launched, a two-year fixed deal, and when we launched our current one-year fixed product, it was also the cheapest in the UK.\"\r\n\r\nIt added its customers could switch tariffs at any time without any charge being applied, and they could sign up to be alerted to potentially better deals when they became available.

"text":"Note: On February 18, 2016, the press release was corrected as follows: In the debt list, under issuer E. ON SE, the affirmation was changed to \u201CCommercial paper, affirmed P-2\u201D. Revised release follows\r\n\r\nLondon, 13 February 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service, (Moody's) has today placed on review for downgrade the Baa1 senior unsecured ratings of E.ON SE (E.ON) and its guaranteed subsidiaries, E.ON International Finance B.V. and E.ON Beteiligungen GmbH. Concurrently, the rating agency affirmed the group's P-2 short-term ratings.\r\n\r\nA full list of affected ratings is provided towards the end of this press release.\r\n\r\nRATING RATIONALE\r\n\r\nToday's action reflects E.ON's exposure to a weakening power and commodity price environment. Forward baseload prices in Germany have declined by more than 20% in the last three months, reflecting a decline in commodity prices, notably coal and CO2 which dropped by 20% and 33% during the same period respectively. Current one-year forward baseload prices of around EUR23\/ MWh are below Moody's estimates published in June 2015 of a EUR30-35\/ MWh range over 2015. At the same time, prices in the Nordic region have deteriorated, by around 22% in the last three months. High hydrology also affects current one-year forward baseload prices of around EUR18\/ MWh, below Moody's estimates published in June 2015 of a EUR25-30\/ MWh range.\r\n\r\nE.ON has a diversified generation portfolio, with around 25% of attributable capacity and 38% of output exposed to outright power (nuclear, hydro and lignite), lower than some of its peers. Nonetheless, while we note that outright production is largely hedged over 2016 and 2017, Moody's expects greater earnings deterioration from generation as hedges run off in the future. Additionally, E.ON's Russian operations are exposed to lower ruble\/euro rates, which will have an effect on earnings from that region.\r\n\r\nThe rating review reflects the company's potentially reduced financial flexibility as it takes steps to determine the capital structure of both future E.ON and Uniper, in the context of a volatile operating environment, before the proposed spin-off of Uniper later this year.\r\n\r\nMoody's notes the considerable efforts taken by the company to reduce debt and improve liquidity over recent years. resulting in credit metrics of FFO\/net debt of 23.7% and RCF\/net debt of 20.1% in 2014, and debt has reduced further in 2015. Nonetheless, E.ON's ability to maintain a financial profile consistent with a Baa1 rating may be hampered by the need to support a stronger financial profile at Uniper to mitigate the pressure on its business profile of the recent power, commodity and foreign exchange developments. E.ON has a target of an investment grade rating at this entity.\r\n\r\nThe review will also factor the outcome, if known, of the deliberations by the nuclear commission appointed by the government to consider a partial or full externalization of funding to cover the industry's nuclear obligations, which are to be backed by contributions from the generators. Moody's expects that while a pragmatic solution is sought, key credit considerations will be any potential residual exposure of the generators to the somewhat unquantifiable risks relating to final storage, in addition to the pace and scale of any such funding.\r\n\r\nThe rating action takes place in the context of the proposed restructuring of the E.ON group that envisages the allocation of the majority of the shares to existing shareholders in the newly established company, Uniper, which will hold the group's power, gas up- and midstream and commodity businesses. The networks, renewables, and customer solutions businesses will remain with E.ON, which will also retain the associated assets and liabilities in relation to its nuclear generation activities. The company plans to present the capital structure and strategic plans of both companies to the capital markets in April or May prior to the AGM in early June. Moody's expects to conclude the review in the light of this more complete information. Nonetheless, it may be a number of months following the AGM before the capital structures of both companies are finally implemented. Moody's notes that the transaction might lead to actions from such stakeholders, which could also be relevant to the future risk profile of both E.ON and Uniper.\r\n\r\nWHAT COULD CHANGE THE RATING UP\/DOWN\r\n\r\nThe ratings could be confirmed if the company can demonstrate that it is well on track to establish a financial structure in line with a Baa1 rating. The rating agency is likely to establish guidance for the rating category when further details of any proposed nuclear solution are known.\r\n\r\nThe ratings could be downgraded if it appears unlikely that an appropriate financial structure for a Baa1 rating can be maintained. This could be as a result of the challenging business environment or if requirements in relation to the prefunding or externalization of nuclear obligations prove unduly onerous.\r\n\r\nMoody's expects that any downgrade is likely to be limited to one notch and expects to conclude the review within 90 days.\r\n\r\nThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Unregulated Utilities and Unregulated Power Companies published in October 2014.

"text":"LONDON \u2014 Royal Dutch Shell became the latest big energy company to file a damage report on the impact of depressed oil prices, saying on Thursday that its adjusted profit fell 56 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a year earlier.\r\n\r\nBut the company\u2019s stock rose about 5 percent in Amsterdam trading, as Shell said it would maintain its dividend, paying out at least $1.88 a share for 2016.\r\n\r\nPromising to continue to pay dividends, which some other big petroleum companies have also pledged to do, is one of the few ways to reward investors during the industry\u2019s lean times \u2014 although some analysts question how long the payouts can be sustained if oil prices continue to languish.\r\n\r\nShell said earnings adjusted for inventory changes were $1.8 billion, down sharply from $4.2 billion in the comparable period of 2014.\r\n\r\nFor all of 2015, its earnings fell 80 percent to $3.84 billion, compared with $19 billion in 2014.\r\n\r\nOn a conference call with reporters on Thursday, Ben van Beurden, Shell\u2019s chief executive, said that the pending acquisition of the British oil and gas producer BG Group, which is expected to be completed in a few weeks, would be an opportunity to further streamline Shell\u2019s operations as it adapts to the changing energy industry.\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nRelated Coverage\r\n\r\n    Exxon Mobil\u2019s Profits Fall and BP Cites Low Oil Prices in $3.3 Billion Loss FEB. 2, 2016\r\n    Shell Shareholders Approve Acquisition of BG Group JAN. 27, 2016\r\n\r\nMr. van Beurden said that Shell had already cut about 7,500 full-time and contractor positions and that an additional 2,800 jobs would be eliminated from the two companies after the merger. He also promised \u201Cimpactful decisions\u201D on matters like capital spending.\r\n\r\nIn an immediate move to preserve capital, Shell said it would postpone two major projects: a liquefied natural gas operation in Canada and a deepwater oil and gas development off Nigeria.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are making substantial changes in the company, \u201C Mr. van Beurden said, \u201Cas we refocus Shell and respond to lower oil prices.\u201D\r\n\r\nShell\u2019s diminished earnings came as ConocoPhillips, the third largest American oil company, announced that it was slashing its dividend by two-thirds, and that it posted a $3.5 billion loss in the fourth quarter, compared with a net loss of $39 million the year before.\r\n\r\nConocoPhillips is the largest American oil company so far to cut its dividend, in another sign of extreme stress, which has already led to scores of bankruptcies of smaller companies.\r\n\r\nLow prices for oil and natural gas were responsible for a drop in ConocoPhillips revenues of 42 percent to $6.8 billion. The company also wrote down the value of its oil properties and exploration assets by $2.2 billion.\r\n\r\nSince it spun off its refineries more than three years ago, the company no longer receives any benefits for lower oil and natural gas prices, which make refining more profitable.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhile we don\u2019t know how far commodity prices will fall or the duration of the downturn,\u201D said Ryan Lance, ConocoPhillips\u2019s chief executive in a statement, \u201Cwe believe it\u2019s prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time.\u201D\r\n\r\nChevron last week reported its first quarterly loss since 2002. BP on Tuesday reported a $3.3 billion fourth-quarter loss. Exxon Mobil on that same day said that its profit for the quarter had declined 58 percent.\r\nOil Prices: What to Make of the Volatility\r\n\r\nOver the last two and a half years, the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s.\r\n\r\nFor Shell, despite the cushioning effects of its large refining and chemicals business, the falling prices of oil and gas are still doing damage. Each $10 a barrel change in the oil price, the company says, has an impact of about $3.3 billion on annual earnings.\r\n\r\nShell had forecast gloomy earnings two weeks ago, before the vote by shareholders on the proposed acquisition of BG. A few days later, investors approved the acquisition.\r\n\r\nShell estimated on Thursday that its reserves of oil and gas still in the ground and under the sea floor, fell by 1.4 billion barrels in the past year, to 11.7 billion barrels, as falling prices had prompted the company to remove some of them from its books.\r\nNewsletter Sign Up\r\nContinue reading the main story\r\nSign up for the all-new DealBook newsletter\r\n\r\nOur columnist Andrew Ross Sorkin and his Times colleagues help you make sense of major business and policy headlines \u2014 and the power-brokers who shape them.\r\nYou agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for The New York Times's products and services.\r\n\r\n    See Sample Privacy Policy Opt out or contact us anytime \r\n\r\nTo assure future operations, oil companies need to add to their reserves to replace production. That is one reason Shell has been intent on acquiring BG Group, which would add an estimated 3.6 billion barrels of reserves.\r\n\r\nShell produced 1.1 billion barrels in 2015.\r\n\r\nWith petroleum prices down about 70 percent over the last 18 months, the oil industry is experiencing its most brutal downturn since the late 1990s. That period, a time of widespread job losses among oil companies, was a time of industry consolidation, as BP acquired Amoco and Exxon merged with Mobil.\r\n\r\nBack then, Shell stayed on the deal-making sidelines. But during the current downturn, the company has been the only big oil company to make a bold move in buying BG Groupfor cash and shares now worth about $50 billion.\r\n\r\nThat deal proved divisive with investors, some of whom worried about Shell making a large takeover at a time when oil prices were still on the way down.\r\n\r\nMr. van Beurden has long tried to persuade investors that the BG acquisition is not an expensive gamble but rather an opportunity to choose the best of both companies and to cut jobs and expenses like exploration. BG will also raise Shell\u2019s status as Europe\u2019s largest oil and gas company. But that distinction may be difficult to celebrate at a time of falling fuel prices.\r\n\r\nBig oil companies have responded to plummeting prices by cutting capital spending and operating expenses. But with prices lower than most forecasts, analysts and rating agencies are beginning to argue that Shell and other companies may need to go much further.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's downgraded Shell\u2019s long-term credit one notch \u2014 to A+ from AA- \u2014 and put five other European oil majors, including BP and the French company Total, on watch for similar potential downgrades.\r\n\r\nIn explaining its downgrade of Shell, S.&P. said it expected the company to generate significantly less cash than it planned to pay out in dividends and capital expenditures through 2017. The agency also said that Shell might be further downgraded after the completion of the BG acquisition.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe now believe many major oil and gas companies\u2019 current and prospective core debt coverage metrics are likely to remain below our rating guidelines for two or three years as the industry adjusts to lower prices,\u201D S.&P. said in a statement.\r\n\r\nThe pressure on the companies\u2019 earnings also raises questions about whether they can continue to pay the generous dividends that are now a crucial attraction for investors \u2014 particularly if prices remain in the current range of $30 a barrel, or even lower.\r\n\r\nBP, in announcing its big loss on Tuesday, said it would continue its 10-cents-a-share dividend but planned to review it each quarter. In a note to clients on Wednesday, Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, wrote that \u201C2016 is likely to be a year of transition for BP with limited ability\u201D to cover its dividend unless oil prices rose substantially.\r\n\r\nSo far, most oil company chiefs have stuck by their commitments to continue paying dividends. But the dividends, which cost the companies billions of dollars each year and were set when oil was selling for more than $100 a barrel, could prove hard to sustain."},

"text":"Summary\r\n\r\nOil prices have continued to fall sharply reaching a 12-year low on January 20, and it is not clear if the 19% rise in Brent crude oil indicates a bottom.\r\n\r\nOil price will eventually recover. However, investing directly in oil by future contracts will cause part or all the profit from price appreciation to be lost due to contango conditions.\r\n\r\nInvesting in a supermajor integrated oil & gas company like Royal Dutch Shell will give investors a significant price appreciation when oil prices recover, along very generous dividend yielding 8.4%.\r\n\r\nShell has a strong balance sheet, and it has been able to generate a positive free cash flow in 2015 of $0.9 billion.\r\n\r\nDespite the extremely low oil price in the fourth quarter, Shell's upstream operations have shown earnings of $0.5 billion.\r\n\r\nOil prices have continued to fall sharply reaching a 12-year low on January 20, and it is not clear if the 19% rise in Brent crude oil and 10.2% increase of WTI crude oil since then indicates a bottom. However, oil price will eventually recover sooner or later. As no one has anticipated crude oil plunging 70% in a year and a half, it is impossible at this moment to determine when oil prices start to climb. However, we can try to get some conclusions from the previous crash in oil prices due to the global financial crisis in 2008. WTI crude fell 63.1% in less than eight months from an all-time record of $143.28 a barrel on July 03, 2008, to $52.90 on February 19, 2009. However, after one year, on July 02, 2009, WTI price climbed 40.8% from February bottom, and after three years, on July 01, 2011, the oil price was 79.5% up from 2009 bottom, as shown in the table and charts below. Of course, current global economic conditions are different (for the better), and the same pattern has not been repeated. However, commodities prices are moving in cycles, and lower capital expenditures on exploration and production will eventually cause oil prices to rebound."},

"text":"At first glance this looks like a terrible time to buy energy stocks. Oil prices are at historic lows, demand has pulled back, inventories are climbing, and global manipulators like OPEC and Iran are doing little to help.\r\n\r\nBut contrarian investing is successful because we invest against the herd and simple \u201Cfirst-level\u201D notions. I warned you to stay away from big oil when the goo was trading 50% higher, and I hope you listened. But oil prices will eventually find a bottom \u2013 and it\u2019s almost time to get our big oil shopping list ready.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 pays just 2.3%, but the firms I\u2019m talking about pay from 3.9% all the way up to 8.7%. And these management teams take their dividends seriously \u2013 they continue to reiterate their commitments to keeping their payouts. ConocoPhillips (COP) CFO Jeff Sheets recently said that \"Our top priority is the dividend. A compelling dividend is a core element of our value proposition and we think it is still appropriate.\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for Mr. Sheets, bad economics trumped his top priority. Yesterday, Conoco announced it lost $3.5 billion in the fourth quarter - and it\u2019ll be slashing its dividend by more than 60%.\r\n\r\nWho will be next to drop the dividend? I\u2019ve got a few likely candidates in the sector. But first, let\u2019s talk about the safest payout even today...\r\n\r\nExxon Mobil Corporation (XOM) reported brutal fourth quarter earnings this week. Revenues fell 31.5% and earnings plunged 58% lower. That's an earnings decrease of $501 million versus the prior quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014 the company realized a price of $63.30 per barrel of crude and $3.72 per cubic foot of natural gas. But last quarter, Exxon only received $34.36 and $1.80 respectively for the same fuel. That's a 45% lower for crude and a 51% lowered in natural gas.\r\n\r\nLower profits mean less cash, and Exxon has tapered its share buyback program, reduced its capital expenditures by 25%, and shored up its financing. This will help the firm fund its dividend and acquire cheap assets. The company added six new major start-ups in 2015, and plans to have six more in 2016.\r\n\r\nExxon CEO & Chairman Rex W. Tillerson commented: \u201CThe scale and diversity of our cash flows, along with our financial strength, provide us with the confidence to invest through the cycle to create long-term shareholder value.\u201D\r\n\r\nExxon pays a $2.92 dividend \u2013 good for a 3.9% yield. The firm has increased its dividend to investors for 33 consecutive years. Even last year, the company increased payouts by 6.7%.\r\n\r\nThe stock sits below $75 a share and is just 20% lower than last year \u2013 impressive resilience given the energy price crash. This is the most secure dividend in big oil. Exxon\u2019s 61% payout ratio represents its highest since 2002, and it\u2019s higher than the 50% I normally require, but this dividend is in the best shape of any. The next three companies are all losing money at the moment, which means they boast negative payout ratios...\r\n\r\nChevron Corporation (CVX) announced a fourth quarter loss of $588 million. That\u2019s not surprising given its average realized price for crude was $38.71 for the quarter versus $68.32 for the same barrel a year earlier! That's a 43% sales haircut.\r\n\r\nThe real story behind Chevron is a number of larger capital projects coming online and a repositioning of the firm's assets and portfolio. The first shipments of LNG from its Australian Gorgon facility will start soon, while three additional major projects at Chuandongbei, Lianzi, and Moho Nord came online last quarter. Now these projects can start making money instead of being capital drains.\r\n\r\nChevron's total spending for last year dropped 12% to $61 billion and the firm expects to cut outlays another 18% in 2016 with the completion of these projects. Chevron's stock is down 22% from its high last February and currently sits at $81. The company pays a $4.28 dividend for a 5.3% yield.\r\n\r\nAt the last quarterly conference call Chevron's Chairman and CEO John Watson said: \"Our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend. We have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this.\"\r\n\r\nProblem is, as long as the company is losing money, these payouts are likely to be funded by additional debt. I respect the dividend dedication, but I don\u2019t like to see unprofitable firms sharing profits that are non-existent. Until Chevron gets its finances in order, investors should avoid this yield mirage.\r\n\r\nBP plc ADR (BP) delivered an even uglier fourth quarter report. Net income dropped 90% to $196 million. BP currently pays a $0.60 quarterly dividend, yielding 8.3%. Surprisingly, the company announced that it will maintain the dividend for the first quarter of the year.\r\n\r\nBP has taken a number of aggressive restructuring charges over the last five quarters totaling $1.5 billion with another $1 billion planned for 2016. The company's cost measures have helped decrease operating costs by $3.4 billion, mostly in efficiency savings. Additionally, the company will slash 7,000 jobs this year.\r\n\r\nIt seems that BP was barely out of their Horizon Deepwater oil spill disaster \u2013 which has cost the company upwards of $65 billion \u2013 when they were hit with a crumbling oil market. However, the fear of the litigation costs and global scrutiny these past few years may have given the company a jump start on belt tightening.\r\n\r\nOf the major oil producers, BP is in the weakest financial shape. To be honest, it should have cut its dividend already. Over the last 12 months, it lost $2.49 per share while paying out $2.40 in dividends.\r\n\r\nHow\u2019d it bridge the gap? With $5 billion in additional long-term debt.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Dutch Shell plc ADR (RDS.A) and BG Group plc ADR (BRGYY) merger, which looked liked such a win-win for everyone has grown a bit complicated as the deal nears completion. The premium has shrunk, as have the benefits of the merger with prices under $90 a barrel.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are still some takeaways for investors to breathe easier about. First, Shell has never cut or suspended its dividend in 40 years. That includes the late 1980s when oil was at $10. And despite a 56% drop in fourth quarter profits, the firm has reiterated it will maintain its dividend for 2016.\r\n\r\nThe firm has delayed capital expenditures and cut spending. It plans to slash another 3% of its employees this year after the merger.\r\n\r\nThe Shell BG merger increases Shell's reserves by 25% and its output by 20%. More importantly, it makes Shell a well positioned producer of LNG \u2013 a segment that is growing internationally as oil declines. The merger takes Shell from third to the second largest public oil producer by capitalization after Exxon.\r\n\r\nShell currently pays an 8.4% dividend. The merger only improves the bottom line and its ability to pay dividends as BG is profitable. But as with every energy firm not named \u201CExxon\u201D I\u2019d wait for the dust to clear on this one.\r\n\r\nSafer 7% Yields You Can Buy NOW\r\n\r\nOil is an absolute necessity in every corner of the globe and the sector will certainly be ripe with buying opportunities once prices stabilize. Until that happens, I\u2019m raking in much bigger \u2013 and safer \u2013 yields in another sector that\u2019s capitalizing on the biggest demographic shift in U.S. history.\r\n\r\nYou see, no matter what happens to the price of oil, the outcome of year\u2019s election, or even China or the Fed, there\u2019s one sure economic bet in America: The country will be older in the future than it is now and demand for healthcare services is set to skyrocket.\r\n\r\nIn fact, by 2024, national healthcare expenditures are expected to climb to $5.43 trillion, that\u2019s about 20% of our GDP.\r\n\r\nThis growth is fueled in large part by the Baby Boom generation. They make up 28% of the U.S. population and number 77 million strong. 10,000 of them turn 65 every single day and will continue to do so every day for the next 15 years.\r\n\r\nI\u2019ve uncovered three particularly solid healthcare plays that are set to reap massive profits from this demographic shift.\r\n\r\nThey pay yields of 7.1%, 7.7%, and 7.9%, and all three are increasing earnings and their dividends annually.

"text":"This year has started off rough for the markets. The S&P is down more than 5% as of this writing. \r\n\r\nIndustrial conglomerates such as Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR) and General Electric (NYSE: GE) have had an even rougher start to the year:\r\n\r\nGE Chart\r\n\r\nGE data by YCharts\r\n\r\nOnly Honeywell (NYSE: HON) is beating the market right now, and just by the hairs on its chinny-chin-chin. Emerson is the worst performer of the lot, with a double-digit loss so far this year. But you should think twice before buying it on the hopes of a turnaround.\r\n\r\nWhat's past is past\r\nEmerson underperformed all of its industrial conglomerate peers in 2015, even managing to lose to the lackluster S&P 500 by nearly 22 percentage points:\r\n\r\nGE Chart\r\n\r\nGE data by YCharts\r\n\r\nBut for large stalwarts like these, you have to remember that stock price appreciation is only part of the overall investment equation. There's also the dividend to consider, and Emerson's is the best in its class:\r\nCompany\t\r\n\r\nDividend Yield (as of 1\/19\/16)\r\nEmerson Electric \t4.40%\r\nSiemens \t4.25%\r\nGeneral Electric \t3.23%\r\nUnited Technologies \t3.01%\r\nHoneywell \t2.45%\r\n\r\nSource: Google Finance. Author's chart.\r\n\r\nOf course, part of its stellar yield is due to its price declines. (Siemens, also a victim of poor performance last year, has a similarly high yield at present.)\r\n\r\nBut even a high dividend yield can't always make up for poor price performance. Here's a chart of the stocks' total returns in 2015, which factors dividends into the equation. Once again, you can see that Emerson is dead last:\r\n\r\nGE Total Return Price Chart\r\n\r\nGE Total Return Price data by YCharts\r\n\r\nIt's a gas\r\nLike many of its peers, Emerson's fortunes are affected by the oil and gas industry. However, Emerson differs in the scope of its oil and gas exposure. Its largest segment by far, Process Management, has heavy oil and gas exposure, servicing oil and gas reservoirs and refineries. Its Industrial Automation segment also has significant oil and gas exposure. It's hardly surprising, then, that these two segments were hit hard in the company's 2015 fiscal year. Process management sales were down 7% YOY, with revenue down 22%. Industrial Automation fared even worse, with sales down 17% and earnings down a whopping 25% YOY.\r\n\r\nThe company specifically blamed oil prices, saying that \"persistent low oil and gas prices reduced capital and operating spending, especially in upstream markets.\" This is an industrywide issue, with companies such as General Electric and Honeywell both seeing declines in divisions with high oil and gas exposure in recent quarters.\r\n\r\nUnlike GE and Honeywell, however, earnings in all of Emerson's divisions -- even those without significant oil and gas exposure -- declined in FY2015. The segment that fared the worst, for example, was Network Power, which saw its earnings halved. By contrast, GE and Honeywell have divisions whose performances are helping to offset the negative effects of oil and gas prices on the company's overall results.\r\n\r\nNo end in sight\r\nWhile GE and Honeywell are both anticipating growth in 2016, despite a sluggish economic environment, Emerson hasn't made any such predictions. The company had a strong start to 2015, so its YOY comparisons are likely to be negative in the first couple of quarters of 2016, according to Chairman and CEO David Farr in the company's latest earnings call:\r\n\r\n    [W]e're ready for, what I would say, the first negative quarter and then the second negative quarter, which I believe underlying sales could be down somewhere in the 5% to 6% range, and then we'll start coming out both from an easy comparison but also seeing some stability in the markets we serve. \r\n\r\nFarr sounded optimistic notes, but even his optimism sounded, well, somewhat pessimistic:\r\n\r\n    Yes, our underlying sales were down over 2%. Yes, our reported sales were down 9%. ... The environment is what the environment is. We deal with it, but we're going to try to control what we can control and we're going to control our profitability, our cash flow, our return, and any acquisitions we can get done.\r\n\r\nInvestors' takeaway\r\nIn spite of Emerson's stellar dividend -- and it really is stellar -- there's not a lot to be optimistic about for Emerson in the near term. When the best you can look forward to is stabilization of YOY numbers because your prior-year numbers are so dismal, that's pretty weak sauce for investors to stomach. And if things in the oil markets don't turn around, as anticipated? Yikes.\r\n\r\nThe outlooks for GE and Honeywell seem more upbeat, although both are making projections based on optimistic 2016 oil price numbers. GE is reinventing its entire company by divesting large portions of its GE Capital financial business portfolio and selling its storied Appliances unit. Honeywell is coming off six consecutive years of double-digit earnings growth, with predictions that growth will continue. Emerson is coming off an exceptionally weak year with a plan to \"try to control what [it] can control.\" \r\n\r\nWhat you should control are your expectations for Emerson in 2016."},

"text":"They're both big industrial conglomerates. They both begin with a seven-letter word, and end in \"Electric.\" They both pay a nice dividend. \r\n\r\nBut there are more similarities than these for General Electric (NYSE: GE) and Emerson Electric (NYSE: EMR). Their plans for 2016 are also surprisingly similar. It's unclear, though, whether those plans will pay off for shareholders.\r\n\r\nA rough start to the year\r\nBoth companies' stocks have had a rough start to 2016, along with the broader market:\r\n\r\nEMR Chart\r\n\r\nEMR data by YCharts.\r\n\r\nWhile GE has been a decent long-term performer, Emerson has lagged the market by a mile during the past five years, even when its generous dividend is factored in:\r\n\r\nEMR Total Return Price Chart\r\n\r\nEMR Total Return Price data by YCharts.\r\n\r\nSo it's somewhat surprising that GE and Emerson are pursuing the same three strategies going forward:\r\n\r\nStrategy No. 1: Divestitures\r\nBoth GE and Emerson are shedding parts of their companies. GE is selling its appliances unit to Chinese company Haier, and is divesting itself of many of its financial businesses. Emerson, meanwhile, has divested its commercial-storage business, and floated the idea of divesting more, as well as spinning off its underperforming Network Power unit into a stand-alone company.\r\n\r\nFor GE, the strategy seems to be working, at least for now. Divesting most of its financial unit allows it to focus on its core industrial businesses, and is generating a lot of cash. GE plans to apply to the government for de-designation of GE Capital as a Systemically Important Financial Institution, which will allow it to return a lot of that cash to shareholders.  And consumer appliances are a low-margin business that was sold at a premium price, so that's a net positive for the company, as well.\r\n\r\nFor Emerson, the picture is mixed. It hasn't released many details about its proposed Network Power spinoff, so it's unclear how it will affect the company's bottom line. And even without the Commercial Storage business, underlying sales in its Commercial and Residential Solutions unit declined 2% last quarter.\r\n\r\nWhile Emerson's Network Power business has been slumping lately, it hasn't been doing as poorly as some of the other company's core businesses, particularly Industrial Automation, which saw sales decline 30% last quarter, compared to Network Power's 6% slide. It's tough to gain advantage by cutting dead wood when even your live wood is rotting.\r\n\r\nStrategy No. 2: The double down\r\nOddly, the businesses that Emerson and GE aren't spinning off are their oil and gas businesses. These have been hit incredibly hard since fuel prices began dropping in 2014.\r\n\r\nInstead of selling or spinning off the oil and gas business, though, GE is reportedly looking to acquire more of the market by purchasing Halliburton's drilling business. Emerson, too, is hanging on. On a recent earnings call, Emerson CEO David Farr said: \"Clearly, we have a challenging oil and gas and industrial marketplace right now but it's nothing new. We have been there before. We know what to do to deal with this issue.\"\r\n\r\nWhether staying the course is a smart move or not won't be clear anytime soon. It's possible that oil and gas prices will jump to a full recovery in 2016, reviving orders, and reversing the fortunes of GE and Emerson's oil and gas units. It's equally possible that prices will continue to languish or fall even further. \r\n\r\nEmerson's worse off than GE here, though, with a larger portion of its business coming from the oil and gas sector than General Electric.\r\n\r\nStrategy No. 3: Cut, baby, cut\r\nBoth companies have identified \"cutting costs\" and \"restructuring\" as a way they intend to juice profits in the face of weak energy prices. Emerson's Farr said, \"[The energy market is] why we started the aggressive restructuring last year.... [I]f the market continues to get challenging, we will continue to do additional restructuring.\"\r\n\r\nIn a recent interview, GE's CFO Jeff Bornstein said nearly the exact same thing. He announced that GE was doubling its 2016 restructuring budget, to $3.4 billion, \"with an emphasis on Oil and Gas.\"  The company will also move its headquarters to Boston from Connecticut to avoid some state taxes, but the actual savings will likely be negligible given GE's massive size and global footprint. \r\n\r\nCutting costs is generally an effective way to increase profitability. The only downside is that cutting costs too much can impede business growth. It's a fine line to walk, but the seasoned management teams at Emerson and GE have enough experience that they can hopefully find a happy medium. Emerson's Farr has been CEO since 2000, and GE's CEO Jeff Immelt has been CEO since 2001.\r\n\r\nThe Foolish bottom line\r\nLow oil and gas prices coupled with an uncertain economic outlook for 2016 have caused problems for both these companies, and their shareholders. However, while GE predicts modest growth, Emerson is predicting declines.\r\n\r\nBoth companies are trying to execute the same three strategies to weather the storm, but it's not going to be easy. There's nothing either company can do about energy prices, so short of selling their oil and gas units altogether -- which would leave Emerson without much of a company! -- all they can do is cut what costs they can, and cross their fingers. \r\n\r\nUntil oil and gas prices recover, though, neither company's stock is going to perform the way shareholders would like. And even then, Emerson's track record of underperformance may continue. You may want to steer clear of these stocks until such a recovery begins."},

"text":"Thematically, Emerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) and Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV)  have much in common. Both are industrials with heavy expsure to the oil & gas sector and dividend aristocrats with around 60 years of increasing dividends behind them. The bull case for both stocks lies within the idea that 2016 will prove to be a trough year in their underlying earnings, and that their current valuations provide compelling value for long-term investors in anticipation of a 2017 rebound. Let's take a closer look to see if this thesis has merit.\r\n\r\nDOV Chart\r\n\r\nDOV data by YCharts\r\n\r\nDividend coverage?\r\nAt first glance Emerson Electric's 4.1% dividend yield is more attractive than Dover Corporation's 2.8% but let's look deeper into sustainability and growth prospects. The best way is to look at free-cash-flow (FCF) -- the cash left over from earnings used to pay dividends and debt.\r\n\r\nDespite facing a tough 2016 both companies are set to generate healthy FCF in 2016. Dover expects to convert 11% of 2016 sales into FCF and and Emerson Electric recently guided toward $3 billion in operating cash flow for 2016.\r\n  \t\r\n\r\nFCF 2016 Est ($million)\r\n\tDividends Paid 2016 Est \t\r\n\r\nFCF\/Dividend Cover\r\n\t\r\n\r\nForward EV\/FCF\r\n\r\nDover Corporation\r\n\t770 \t270 \t2.9 \t15.2\r\n\r\nEmerson Electric\r\n\t1280 \t1280 \t1.9 \t14.4\r\n\r\nSOURCE: AUTHORS ANALYSIS. EV IS ENTERPRISE VALUE, MARKET CAP PLUS NET DEBT\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, both have decent dividend coverage, but Dover looks better placed. Emerson's current yield of 4.1% is more generous, but even if Dover paid the equivalent in dividend its coverage would be slightly better. Moreover, Emerson plans to spinoff its network power segment -- important because according to management it's a \"good cash flow generation business.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, it's worth checking the numbers against historical figures as some industrials can see sharp increases in FCF during recessions (capital expenditures get cut, but then have to be increas CapEx when the recovery comes) but as you can see below the forecast 2016 numbers are above the 10 year averages (both around 11%) but not significantly so, and I would still give Dover the slight edge here.\r\n\r\nDov Emer\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE: COMPANY PRESENTATIONS, AUTHOR'S ESTIMATES\r\n\r\nEnd market exposures\r\nThe first chart above shows both companies have been hit hard by falling energy prices. Going back to 2014 Dover generated 34.5% of its segmental earnings from its energy segment, and its fluid segment (18.8%) also has energy exposure. Meanwhile, Emerson Electric generated 44% of its fiscal 2014 segmental earnings from its energy heavy, process management segment.\r\n\r\nEmerson's latest quarterly earnings saw earnings before taxes drop 34% and with process management earnings down 31%, meanwhile Dover's earnings before taxes fell 27% and its energy segment earnings fell 70%.\r\n\r\nIt gets worse.\r\n\r\nBoth companies are exposed to the kind of industrial spending areas being hit in the current slowdown, and have seen significant declines in their order books.\r\n\r\nDov Emr\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE: DOVER CORPORATION PRESENTATIONS\r\n\r\nEmerson Electric's order book isn't much better.\r\n \t\r\n\r\nDecember Trailing Three Month Orders\r\n\t\r\n\r\nShare of Q1 2016 Segment Earnings\r\n\r\nProcess Management\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(15%)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n42%\r\n\r\nIndustrial Automation\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(20%) to (15%)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n14.8%\r\n\r\nNetwork Power\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(10%) to (5%)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n13%\r\n\r\nClimate Technologies\r\n\t\r\n\r\n(10%) to (5%)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n16.9%\r\n \r\n\r\nCommercial & Residential Solutions\r\n\t \r\n\r\n(5%) to Flat\r\n\t \r\n\r\n13.2%\r\n\r\nDATA SOURCE: EMERSON ELECTRIC PRESENTATIONS\r\n\r\nEmerson better on end market basis\r\nThat said, I would prefer Emerson Electric on an end-market exposure basis. It's true that oil\/energy matters less to Dover because of its fall (the energy segment was responsible for less than 14% of segment earnings in the last quarter), but Emerson Electric's CEO David Farr argues that only 25% of Emerson Electric's overall business serves the \"oil and gas marketplace.\"\r\n\r\nMoreover, Dover's oil & gas business primarily provides upstream solutions. In other words, it's reliant on rig activity and oil production. Emerson's business has upstream exposure, but it also has downstream exposure and management spoke of \"favorable\" markets in U.S., Europe, and Middle East. Theoretically, downstream could benefit from low oil prices because they induce higher volumes in say, petroleum refining or chemicals.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Emerson's guidance for 2016 includes expectations for modest growth in its climate technologies and commercial & residential solutions businesses, and its overall sales are expected to turn positive in the third-quarter.\r\n\r\nThe pick?\r\nIf you are looking for a value stock with some upside to potentially higher oil prices and stabilization in the industrial sector in 2016 then both stocks are attractive, but if forced to choose Emerson is better. Its end markets are arguably more favorable than Dover's and there isn't much difference on a dividend coverage basis. Throw in the cheaper valuation (based on the forward EV\/FCF estimates in the first table) and I would take Emerson Electric over Dover Corporation."},

"text":" In March 2016, Chicago\u2019s Museum of Science and Industry will open an exhibition called \u201CBrick by Brick,\u201D featuring, among other LEGO creations, a 60-foot replica of the Golden Gate Bridge. The exhibition marries the museum\u2019s ability to produce complex, ambitious exhibitions with LEGO\u2019s status as \u201Ca venerable, well-loved brand that has had a real resurgence in the last five to ten years,\u201D says Matt Simpson, the museum\u2019s chief marketing officer.\r\nSubscribe\r\n\r\nGet the latest from Kellogg Insight delivered to your inbox.\r\n\r\nFor Simpson\u2019s marketing team, building a show around a great product is only half the battle. The team also has to figure out how to use digital technology to generate interest and add value to the exhibition.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe\u2019ll use digital media to do some storytelling at the front end,\u201D Simpson explained. \u201CAnd we\u2019ll look to use digital in fun and new ways that extend the experience. We may allow kids to design something using digital tools, for instance, and then create it using 3-D printing. So you may be using digital tools, but your creation isn\u2019t trapped there.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn other words, the team\u2019s strategy takes full advantage of new technology to tell a story and encourage engagement with a brand. Simpson and others at the 2015 Kellogg Marketing Leadership Summit emphasize the importance of creating a culture that can embrace innovation and respond nimbly to challenges at a time when digital tools are proliferating rapidly.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe question for organizations is how they can adapt what they do well while also changing what they don\u2019t do well,\u201D says Gregory Carpenter, a professor of marketing and director of the Center for Market Leadership at Kellogg. \u201CEvery organization develops a culture based on past experiences, and then they\u2019re faced with a new reality. And that new reality is digital.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo be adept at digital, you have to be fast, you have to be agile, you have to be decentralized and less structured, and you have to have more cooperation and trust,\u201D Carpenter says. \u201CThe big challenge organizations face is transforming themselves from hierarchical and centralized to more collaborative and trusting.\u201D\r\n\r\nHere are ways companies are looking to master their digital-media marketing strategies.\r\nUsing Digital Partnerships\r\n\r\nTo create \u201CBrick by Brick,\u201D the Museum of Science and Industry partnered with Adam Reed Tucker, one of about a dozen LEGO Master Builders in the world.\r\n\r\nThe collaboration makes sense logistically\u2014Reed Tucker lives in the Chicago area\u2014and synergistically, since it gives LEGO and Reed Tucker a stake in the exhibition\u2019s success. The digital possibilities of this partnership are especially promising. The museum will enhance its YouTube presence, market the exhibition, and add value for guests\u2014and potential guests\u2014with short, shareable videos that not only document the development of the exhibition\u2019s structures, but invite LEGO fans and digital communities to \u201Cbuild\u201D entirely new creations that become part of the \u201CBrick by Brick\u201D story.\r\n\r\n    \u201CThe big challenge organizations face is transforming themselves from hierarchical and centralized to more collaborative and trusting.\u201D \u2014Gregory Carpenter\r\n\r\nRelated Reading\r\nMarketing Gets Personal\r\n\r\nLeading executives explain how technology is changing the field\u2014and who will lead the charge\r\nPhilip Kotler on Marketing\u2019s Higher Purpose\r\n\r\nHow social marketing can be a force for good.\r\nWhen Marketers Step into the C-Suite\r\n\r\nFour top executives on building credibility with company leadership\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the global manufacturing and technology company Emerson Electric has partnered with Hank Green\u2014a musician, blogger, and science popularizer whose short YouTube videos about science have a particularly large following\u2014to celebrate its 125th anniversary in 2015. Emerson created a platform on its website that features Green\u2019s short videos, as well as links to articles and updates on science and engineering.\r\n\r\nWith their mutual goal of encouraging interest in science, Emerson and Green are an easy fit. Their relationship has helped Emerson reach a broad audience while also building its identity. In a three-month period in early 2015, traffic to Emerson\u2019s website spiked\u2014from about 25,000 page views to nearly 500,000. One explicit benefit to Emerson has been the growing number of people who visit its careers page, resulting in a larger pool of applicants seeking jobs with the company.\r\n\r\nIn another successful partnership, Emerson Electric collaborated with LinkedIn and The Atlantic magazine on a targeted marketing campaign. The Atlantic curated the editorial content, which focused on women and engineering, while LinkedIn used its database to pinpoint recipients. \u201CIt\u2019s been the single most successful thing we\u2019ve done, per dollar,\u201D says Kathy Button Bell, Emerson Electric\u2019s chief marketing officer. \u201CThe engagement level\u2014people reading it, sharing it, pushing it along\u2014is just over the top when you can make the content that precise.\u201D\r\nTelling the Brand Story through Digital\r\n\r\nSuccessful companies can offer customers a significant competitive difference by telling the right story.\r\n\r\nTake the tech industry. What makes many technology companies so successful is not necessarily that their products are faster or objectively better, according to Farhad Manjoo, who writes about technology for The New York Times. Instead, it is the story those companies tell about themselves that makes the difference.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn many ways, Apple is the leader in showing how to survive and thrive in a world dominated by lots of choices,\u201D says Manjoo. \u201CA few years ago, many people in the tech industry thought that competing smartphones would become so good that people would start ditching the iPhone for competitors. And the reason that hasn\u2019t happened is that people have a deep affinity with their iPhones. The story that Apple tells becomes part of their identity.\u201D\r\n\r\nA key to Emerson Electric\u2019s collaboration with Hank Green, according to Button Bell, is the power of digital campaigns to help define and tell a company\u2019s story. The emphasis on storytelling led the company to focus on supporting science education and women in engineering, especially on LinkedIn. That more general advocacy, rather than product-centric appeals, has helped to define, redefine, and expose the company\u2019s values.\r\n\r\n\u201CDoing something about your corporate character, rather than selling, is 100 times more effective when you\u2019re doing social,\u201D Button Bell says, \u201Cbecause it gets shared, and you can\u2019t be a shill. If you\u2019re doing social, it had better be pure of heart. Otherwise, you look like a cheap rug salesman.\u201D\r\n\r\nIn addition to helping you reach the audience you want in a way that comes across as authentic, using the most current media channels conveys a powerful message about how committed the company is to staying cutting edge.\r\nCreating Communal Experiences through Digital\r\n\r\nTV and video streaming and on-demand services have made it increasingly possible for viewers to watch whatever they want, whenever they want to. This has led to TV audience fragmentation. But some shows are bucking the trend, becoming \u201Cappointment television\u201D by using social media to add value to the experience during the shows\u2019 original airings. One of the highest-rated shows on network television, Scandal, is particularly adept at doing so: its cast and crew use Twitter to add commentary in real time during original broadcasts.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere\u2019s this communal feeling that people get when they watch while talking to other people, and that\u2019s lacking when they watch alone,\u201D Manjoo said.\r\n\r\nThe double-edged sword of technology\u2014its fragmenting effects and its ability to bring people together\u2014presents both challenges and opportunities for organizations.\r\n\r\nThe Museum of Science and Industry\u2019s ongoing exhibition, \u201CFuture Energy Chicago,\u201D now offers a multi-participant simulation game in which teams compete against one another, using the same piece of software, to design a system of energy consumption, production, and distribution. The team that creates the most energy-efficient system wins the game.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou can be making a decision across the room that impacts what I see in front of me,\u201D Simpson said. \u201CSo, what you learn very quickly is the interdependence of all the elements.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe game\u2019s fluidity and interactive and cooperative dimensions are a good model for the kind of business cultures that are poised to thrive in the digital era.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn the past, developing a strategy was like making a movie, where you could script everything,\u201D says Carpenter. \u201CToday, it\u2019s much more like improv, and people who are good at making movies aren\u2019t necessarily good at improv. In the more decentralized world, leadership isn\u2019t about dictating. It\u2019s more about developing a shared vision. That\u2019s one reason you see so many more organizations focusing beyond making money on meaning. That focus helps everyone feel more connected to the core mission of the organization.\u201D"}]},

Yet despite its notoriety as the birthplace of Dada, the Zurich theater has been struggling financially, and management is now attempting to sell the club as a $13.1 million sculpture.\r\n\r\nAdrian Notz, the director of Cabaret Voltaire, told Swiss Info that he\u2019s trying to sell the club as a Gesamtkunstwerk. \u201CIt would be nice to offer the sculpture as a living space for artists who would manage the house and run it as a slightly more international meeting place,\u201D says Notz. \u201CThe art market is currently so crazy that it might actually work!\u201D\r\n\r\nThe building is owned by insurance behemoth Swiss Life, and these plans are contingent on the company\u2019s willingness to sell. According to The Art Newspaper, Swiss Life collects an annual sum of $317,000 (CHF 315,000) in rent. In addition, the non-profit needs $502,000 (CHF 500,000) in operations costs.\r\n\r\nIn the past, these expenses were subsidized by the city government and other private players. But in 2008, the right-wing UDC party opposed municipal funding for the establishment, and the watchmaker Swatch subsequently withdrew financial sponsorship.\r\nCabaret Voltaire<br>Photo: Google Maps.\r\n\r\nInside Cabaret Voltaire.\r\nPhoto: Google Maps.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these cuts, the Cabaret Voltaire has largely been left to its own devices in the years that followed, relying on its shop, bar, events, and performances for income.\r\n\r\nIf management succeeds in attracting their desired investor, the Cabaret Voltaire looks forward to plans of expanding its reach. \u201CIt would be good to transform the Cabaret Voltaire into a center for artists to manage the place,\u201D Notz said, \u201Cand give it a more international dimension.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe building has experienced funding issues before, and drastic measures have been taken to keep it afloat.

	"text":"The alternative Dada art movement faces a financial fight for survival. The answer to the problem: turn its Zurich birthplace into a work of art and find a collector who will buy it for the princely sum of CHF13 million ($12.8 million).\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s the reserve price that has been slapped on Cabaret Voltaire in a bid to secure Dada\u2019s future during its centenary year. Now it is just a question of finding a deep-pocketed art lover who can envisage the unassuming building, nestled among cobbled side streets in Zurich\u2019s old town, as a sculpture or oil painting.\r\n\r\nThe novel idea was the brainchild of Swiss artist Kerim Seiler. Cabaret Voltaire director Adrian Notz is convinced that it will not only solve Dada\u2019s immediate financial problems, but will also allow the birthplace of the provocative art form to flourish free of future economic restraints and political bickering.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would be nice to have the sculpture as a residence for artists who would also run it and open it up as a more international venue. That would be a very strong gesture for art. The art market is so crazy at the moment it might actually work!\u201D he told swissinfo.ch.\r\n\r\nAny future benefactor, as yet completely unknown, would be expected to buy into the Dada movement and not just convert the building into apartments. \u201CYou would not buy a Van Gogh, cut it up and make a carpet out of it, because you know it\u2019s an art work,\u201D said Notz. \u201CIn the same sense, you would not want to change anything in Cabaret Voltaire.\u201D The plan is for a future owner to permanently loan the building to Dada artists.\r\n\r\nThe theatre was, after all, reborn as the home of Dada in 2002 (reopening properly in 2004) precisely because it was the very spot where anti-war artists Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings started the movement in 1916.\r\nCabaret Voltaire\r\nDada: artists\u2019 response to WWI\r\nBy Julie Hunt\r\n\r\nZurich was the birthplace of the Dada movement and its opposition to the cultural values artists believed had led to the First World War. \r\n\r\n    in depth: First World War\r\n\r\n    Culture\r\n\r\nSee in other languages: 5\r\nFinancial burden\r\n\r\nKerim Seiler says he wants to \u201Cre-programme\u201D people into perceiving Cabaret Voltaire as an \u201Chistorical monument\u201D. \u201CIt should not be about who owns it. It\u2019s not a piece of material, a tool for making money,\u201D he told swissinfo.ch. \u201CIt\u2019s a place where a couple of migrants [Ball and Hennings] did things that changed our perception of existence.\u201D\r\n\r\nSelling Cabaret Voltaire to an art collector may sound to some people idealistic, and perhaps unrealistic, on the surface. But it might not necessarily be just a pipe dream or a publicity stunt. Eight years ago, a wealth Swiss art lover did express an interest in buying the theatre. The financial crash put paid to that proposed deal, but it proved to Notz that the concept was worth reviving.\r\n\r\nBut why the need for such a drastic and ground-breaking move? The building is owned by insurance giant Swiss Life which charges CHF315,000 rent annually. The non-profit enterprise burns roughly CHF500,000 more in running costs each year.\r\n\r\nSwatch\u2019s CHF300,000+ sponsorship ended several years ago and money from cultural foundations has all but dried up. \u201CDada is not the right image for banks, and it is difficult to find sponsors in general in the current economic climate,\u201D said Notz. \u201CSwiss foundations are focused on Swiss artists and projects. Dada was born here, but it\u2019s not very Swiss. Despite this, we manage to get some support from foundations.\u201D\r\n\r\nSex slaves and \u201Cscandals\u201D\r\n\r\nZurich city council pays Cabaret Voltaire\u2019s rent, but not without a fair amount of political opposition from the conservative right Swiss People\u2019s Party. They are not too fond of taxpayers\u2019 money being spent on the home of such provocative acts as the live casting of sex slaves and a couple whose performance included urinating on each other.\r\n\r\nThe People\u2019s Party launched an unsuccessful initiative in 2008 that called on voters to veto the council decision to financially support the venue. And they did not mince their words in a 2013 postulate protesting plans to help bankroll Dada\u2019s centenary jubilee.\r\n Zurich\u2019s Cabaret Voltaire remains a popular attraction\r\n100 years\r\nDada: the art movement that questioned everything\r\nBy Christian Raaflaub\r\n, Zurich\r\n\r\nDadaism is the only artistic movement that started in Switzerland and conquered the world. \r\n\r\n    Culture\r\n    Human interest\r\n\r\nSee in other languages: 9\r\n\r\nThe postulate condemned CHF4 million of city funds spent between 2003 and 2013 on reviving Dadaism in Zurich, resulting in \u201Cten years of flops, scandals [and] fleeing sponsors\u201D. Dadaism is described as \u201Cabsurd\u201D, \u201Claughable\u201D, \u201Cnonsensical\u201D and \u201Cembarrassing\u201D. It\u2019s initial anti-war platform amid the bombs and gas of 1916 was little more than a fig leaf that has since fallen away completely, according to the postulate.\r\n\r\nDada may seem outrageous to some, but it does not provoke merely for the sake of it, counters Notz. It seeks to challenge stereotypes and remind people that there is life beyond the conformity demanded by the establishment.\r\n\r\nDada zeitgeist\r\n\r\nCaught between cold reality of market forces and the heat of abrasive politics, Cabaret Voltaire needs to break free in order to survive and flourish. A successful crowdfunding scheme raised CHF100,000 for the centenary celebrations, but Notz does not think this is a sustainable option apart from occasional special projects.\r\n\r\nThe theatre does make money from running a shop, a bar and renting out space for artistic performances, birthdays and weddings and corporate Christmas parties. But not enough for financial independence. A wealthy, art loving patron is therefore required to give the home of Dada breathing space as it looks to the next 100 years.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you talk about Dada as a zeitgeist it does not depend on this place,\u201D said Notz. \u201CBut people being people, they like to identify Dada with a space.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt would not be a disaster for Dada if Cabaret Voltaire went out of existence, but it would be a disaster for Zurich. Even if other places identity with Dada, such as Paris or Berlin, there can only be one birthplace.\u201D\r\n\r\nOf course, the revolutionary idea would only work if Swiss Life agrees to sell the building housing Cabaret Voltaire. \u201CIt\u2019s understandable that the house is the subject of creative thinking during this Dada centenary year. Nevertheless, we are not getting involved in any speculation,\u201D the insurance company stated.\r\nDada\u2019s 100th birthday\r\n\r\nThe Dada artistic movement was founded in Zurich by a group of artists led by Hugo Ball and Emmy Hennings in 1916. Cabaret Voltaire was set up as a venue for Dada art and performances. The theatre ran into disrepair and was saved from demolition in 2002 by a group of artists, led by Mark Divo, who illegally occupied the building to prevent its destruction. It opened for business again on September 30, 2004, complete with a subsidy from the city.\r\n\r\nDada was initially an artistic expression of protest against the horrors of the First World War, rejecting established conventions with an anti-aesthetic and often shocking style. There are various interpretations of how the movement got its name, with many believing it was just a nonsensical word chosen to display the movement's contempt of logic. It swiftly spread throughout Europe and the United States and was at its peak between 1916 and 1920.\r\n\r\nOfficially launching on March 5, the movement\u2019s 100th jubilee celebrations will be marked in Zurich with a series of exhibitions and performances throughout the year.

He said ineffective policies and parochialism among provincial officials had exacerbated the problem.\r\n\r\nChina has for decades grappled with overcapacity, which occurs when demand for a product falls below what an industry is capable of producing. But the problem has worsened significantly in recent years, as the government has pumped capital into heavy industries like shipbuilding and glassmaking, even as global demand has fallen.\r\n\r\nDemand for steel, for example, has weakened in recent years.

	"text":"\r\n\r\nWhen the Chinese took over the Las Bambas copper mine here in the Andes Mountains in 2014, Beto Chahuayllo at first barely noticed the change.\r\n\r\nHe kept on painting buildings at the mine, a job he\u2019d been doing for four years in hopes of saving enough to leave his village and his dirt-floor hut and move his family to nearby Cuzco, where the houses have electricity and his children could attend a better school.\r\n\r\nThe new owners, a conglomerate of Chinese state-owned companies, bought the mine while it was still under construction, paying $5.85 billion to the Swiss firm that had started developing it.\r\n\r\nThe Peruvian government welcomed the new investors, predicting that Las Bambas \u2014 a gray gash across the mountains set to be second biggest copper mining operation in the world \u2014 would boost Peru\u2019s gross domestic product by 1.4% once production began.\r\n\r\nNEWSLETTER: Get the day's top headlines from Times Editor Davan Maharaj >>\r\n\r\nThe deal was part of China\u2019s dramatic expansion into Latin America over the last decade, a relationship that has brought enormous benefits to both sides. But China\u2019s investments in the region have increasingly met resistance from the people whose voices register least in the global economy.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the nearby provincial capital of Tambobamba, graffiti appeared on a white construction barrier. In bold red letters, somebody wrote: \u201CSay no to the Chinese.\u201D\r\n\r\nIt was an early sign of the trouble that would soon engulf the communities around the mine. The protests against it would eventually cost Chahuayllo his life.\r\n\r\n::\r\nA Peruvian community adjusts to Chinese ownership of a copper mine\r\n\r\nChinese ownership of a Peruvian copper mine.\r\n\r\nIt seemed a perfect match.\r\n\r\nIn Latin America, China found a new supply of commodities to help fuel its monumental economic growth. And in China, Latin America found a way to ride the coattails of that growth.\r\n\r\nBetween 2001 and 2013, China\u2019s total investment in Latin America and the Caribbean grew from $1 billion to $86 billion, as state-owned companies slurped up oil from Ecuador and Venezuela, soybeans from Argentina and Brazil and copper from Chile and Peru.\r\n\r\nThe investment helped drive the strongest economic performance that Latin America had seen since the 1970s, with GDP growth averaging roughly 3% a year.\r\n\r\n\u201CFinance ministries loved it, and so did the heads of state,\u201D said Kevin Gallagher, a professor at Boston University who studies Chinese investment in the region.\r\n\r\nThat was especially true in the wake of the world financial crisis of 2008, when exports to the United States and Europe fell. \u201CChina became this new growth pole,\u201D Gallagher said.\r\n\r\nBut as China and Latin America have deepened their relationship, not everybody has been so welcoming.\r\n\r\nIn Honduras in 2013, the indigenous Lenca people blocked access to the Chinese-backed Agua Zarca dam, which they said was in their territory, sparking clashes with local security forces. Honduran police shot and killed a protest leader, and Sinohydro \u2014 the world\u2019s biggest hydropower contractor \u2014 eventually terminated the project.\r\n\r\nIn Ecuador in 2014, an indigenous leader battling a $1.4-billion Chinese-backed mine disappeared the day before a scheduled protest over deforestation and displacement of indigenous people. Four days later, his bound and battered body was discovered in an unmarked grave.\r\n\r\nAnd since the Chinese state-run firm Shougang acquired an iron mine in 1992 in Marcona, on Peru\u2019s southern coast, the project has been beset by near-constant unrest over environmental concerns and labor conditions. Last May, police killed a labor organizer during a protest.\r\n\r\nThe conflicts in some respects reflect growing pains. Many Chinese companies are still learning how to navigate diverse, politically complex countries far from home, said Cynthia Sanborn, vice president for research at the University of the Pacific in Lima, Peru's capital.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen you\u2019re in countries that are both democratic and tumultuous \u2014 those that have diverse civil societies with diverse needs \u2014 you have to deal with them,\u201D she said. \u201CThe learning curve is steeper, and they have to learn things that other companies learned generations ago.\u201D\r\n\r\nChina believed its newest copper mine was a test it could pass.\r\n\r\n\u201CLas Bambas was supposed to be the poster child for responsibility in new mining,\u201D Sanborn said.\r\n\r\n::\r\nWidow of Beto Chahuayllo\r\n\r\nAgustine Llusca Aguilar, 35, the widow of Beto Chahuayllo, outside her house in Arcospampa, Peru.  (Noah Fowler \/ For the Los Angeles Times)\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s interest in the mine is clear.\r\n\r\nThe country is addicted to copper, last year gobbling up as much as the rest of the world combined to cast into pipes for new cities and wire into consumer electronics to ship around the globe.\r\n\r\nPeru, the world\u2019s third largest producer of the metal, is one of the biggest beneficiaries of that addiction. While China still invests far less than the U.S. in Latin America and the Caribbean on the whole, its stake in Peru is three times larger.\r\n\r\nLas Bambas was to benefit not only Peru but also the communities around the mine.\r\n\r\nIn some ways, it has. Starting under Swiss ownership, the mine has boosted the local economy and helped modernize the region.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen we got in there in 2004, there wasn\u2019t even currency \u2014 people would exchange goods in the market,\u201D said Luis Rivera, a Peruvian and Las Bambas\u2019 vice president of operations. \u201CNo banks, no phones, no IDs. We had to establish a bank, mobile phones, the Internet.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe mine became the largest employer in the Apurimac region, which has one of Peru\u2019s highest poverty rates. It put 18,000 people to work \u2014 directly and indirectly \u2014 during its construction.\r\n\r\nThe new owners \u2014 led by 62.5% stakeholder MMG, a Melbourne, Australia-based subsidiary of China Minmetals Corp. \u2014 built a town known as Nueva Fuerabamba for villagers displaced by the mine. Compared with the surrounding villages, it is a model of progress, with freshly paved roads, 441 sturdy yellow houses, a health clinic, running water and three churches, each for a different Christian denomination.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe also give them a relocation bonus \u2014 compensation for the lifestyle they have to leave,\u201D said Socrates Cornejo, a Las Bambas community relations officer.\r\n\r\nBut the mine has brought little benefit to many others who live near it, and their discontent was mounting.\r\n\r\nChahuayllo, a leader of the committee that represented his tiny village in meetings with mine officials and the government, started hearing concerns that pollution from the mine could threaten the local fishing and farming industries.\r\n\r\nResidents were worried about the possibility that chemicals might seep into surrounding rivers and the mountainsides.\r\n\r\nThey seized on two major changes the new owners \u2014 with the blessing of the Peruvian government \u2014 made to the original plans.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Chinese added a second factory to process deposits of the mineral molybdenum, and it seemed precariously close to the Challhuahuacho River. Second, rather than build a pipeline to send the copper concentrate to the Pacific port of Matarani, the company decided to haul it by truck, raising fears of endless dust and toxic spills along the 450-mile route.\r\n\r\nMore immediate than those complaints was another: Once the mine started producing copper, more than three-quarters of the jobs created during the construction phase would disappear.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe company came with many promises of money, opportunities and work,\u201D said Roselle Chihualro, Chahuayllo\u2019s brother. \u201CBut we have been cheated.\u201D\r\n\r\nA local politician, Rodolfo Abarca, accused the mine of failing to provide infrastructure and agricultural investments it had promised. \u201CWhy do we have this big project here \u2014 this very important project \u2014 and we are still poor?\u201D he said recently.\r\n\r\nChahuayllo started attending meetings of workers. They wondered how they could have their voices heard, either by their own government or the Chinese executives who spent most of their time outside of Peru.\r\n\r\n::\r\nLas Bambas mine\r\n\r\nThe Las Bambas mine in Peru.  (Noah Fowler \/ For the Los Angeles Times)\r\n\r\nBrewing anger turned to a labor strike and open protest last year.\r\n\r\nFor three days in September, 36-year-old Chahuayllo, his brother and thousands of other poor Peruvians gathered on the outskirts of Challhuahuacho, a ramshackle town at the foot of the mine.\r\n\r\nHis wife, Agustine Llusca Aguilar, stayed home with the five children to tend their horses, lambs and guinea pigs.\r\n\r\nThe shouts of the protesters echoed in the surrounding hills, swelling into a dull roar. Some waved sticks and slingshots. A few flicked cigarettes into the dry grass, sparking small fires that sent wisps of smoke into the bright blue sky.\r\n\r\nSee more of our top stories on Facebook >>\r\n\r\nPerched above the throng at the entrance to the mine, about 1,500 Peruvian police officers stood guard. On the third day of the protests, as tensions rose, they fired tear gas into the air.\r\n\r\n\u201CSome people were trying to run away, some people were crying, and some were insisting on attacking the policemen with the slingshots,\u201D Chihualro recalled.\r\n\r\nHe said his brother trudged uphill toward the police, raising his hands and chanting with the crowd, \u201CLet's negotiate.\u201D \r\n\r\nThen shots rang out, and he fell.\r\n\r\nWhen his brother reached him, blood was gushing from a bullet wound on his right side. \u201CBrother, wake up, please,\u201D Chihualro said he pleaded.\r\n\r\nChahuayllo died that evening at a nearby clinic, one of at least three protesters villagers say were shot and killed by police.\r\n\r\n::\r\nNueva Fuerabamba\r\n\r\nNueva Fuerabamba, a newly constructed town built by MMG for Peruvians displaced by Las Bambas mine. (Noah Fowler \/ For The Times)\r\n\r\nThe next day, Peruvian President Ollanta Humala dispatched military patrols throughout the region, placing four Andean provinces under a state of emergency that would last for a month.\r\n\r\nSoldiers patrolled the streets in major towns and cities. Political gatherings were banned.\r\n\r\n\u201CA few thousand people led by a few cannot stop a project of this size,\u201D the interior minister, Jose Luis Perez, told reporters.\r\n\r\nA week later, community leaders reached an agreement with the Peruvian government, officially ending the strike. The government promised to end the state of emergency and compensate families of those injured or killed during the protest.\r\n\r\nLater that month, the chief executive of Minmetals, He Wenbo, met with the Peru\u2019s deputy minister of mining in Beijing. According to the company, he promised that MMG would \u201Cfuel the development of the local communities in Peru.\u201D\r\n\r\nRivera, the Las Bambas executive, said that the protesters had \u201Csome legitimate grievances\u201D about labor and environmental issues, but he declined to go into detail. The Peruvian government has agreed to hold workshops in the area to discuss local communities\u2019 environmental concerns.\r\n\r\nSeveral dozen locals have refused to leave their old stone-and-mulch homes and move into Nueva Fuerabamba, the newly built neighborhood.\r\n\r\nOne of the holdouts, Porfirio Gutierrez Paniura, said the compensation package was too small. \u201CWe have more land, more animals, and more things to lose, way more than the people who left,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe were OK with the mine,\u201D Paniura said. \u201CBut we want them to understand that we have our richness, and that it has its price.\u201D\r\nLas Bambas mine, Peru\r\n\r\nConveyor belts transport raw material from the Las Bambas open pit to processing facilities. (Noah Fowler \/ For the Los Angeles Times)\r\n\r\nChina\u2019s demand for copper continues to rise, even as its economy has been slowing, driving down world commodity prices and rippling through Latin America economies, which are expected to contract slightly this year.\r\n\r\nLast month MMG announced that Las Bambas made its first shipment, sending 10,000 tons of copper concentrate to China. The mine is expected to produce 450,000 tons of copper annually for the next two decades."}]},

			"text":"It is a truism that Emirates Airline has been a gamechanger. But that is not just in size, but in its comprehensive precision. This is an operation that plans and consistently delivers. In its own words: growth hinges not just on internal capability, but in the capacity of its home airport; the output of factories in Everett and Toulouse; and the willingness of ministries to grant more traffic rights. Consequently it is surprising that a year ago there were few indications 2016 would be as momentous as it appears likely to be: the beginning of the next phase of Emirates' growth.\r\n\r\nFirst in this phase is the internal change in strategy and mindset: to be more receptive to partnerships. There is commercial value in this strategy, but also a recognition of a changing world where bilateral alliances are taking on a more prominent role \u001F\u2013 including Qatar's oneworld alliance membership and Etihad's equity network. Emirates said it will look for more major partnerships along the lines of its expansive Qantas deal; it has since forged a much smaller deal with Malaysia Airlines, and a deeper South African Airways partnership could be next.\r\n\r\nSecond are long-overdue traffic right additions from mainland China, where Emirates has fewer daily flights across the whole country (5) than to Bangkok alone (6). Its first two new points, Yinchuan and Zhengzhou, may not seem lucrative, but other new flights will be.\r\n\r\nThird is Emirates' well-publicised order for A350s or 787s, medium sized widebodies that will allow it to access even more markets. \r\n\r\nThe combination implies a break from Emirates' largely go-at-it-alone strategy using A380s or \"smaller\" 777-300ERs, where India was the main source market in an emerging economy. The result is a more regionally pervasive Emirates. For many airlines, this will intensify competition that they already struggle to contend with. For a select few, a partnership could be on offer.\r\nEmirates is becoming more receptive to partnerships\r\n\r\nPrior to the Qantas-Emirates partnership announced in Sep-2012, Emirates\u2019 partnerships were relatively confined in scope and quantity. The Qantas-Emirates partnership had considerable breadth: Qantas would operate through Emirates\u2019 Dubai hub and there would be revenue sharing and extensive codesharing from both parties on overlapping markets, as well as behind\/beyond gateways. \r\n\r\nThe impact of the Qantas deal was heightened by Emirates stating merely days later that it wanted a deep partnership with American Airlines. The message then, and since then, has been that Emirates would seek partnerships where it made sense, and where value could be extracted.\r\n\r\nWhat has changed in recent months is an expansion of the parameters to define value. Emirates has thus far been unsuccessful in wooing Qantas' partner American Airlines, but it has formed smaller partnerships.\r\n\r\nThe one with TAAG in Angola is perhaps the smallest, while Malaysia Airlines is larger. A second pitch at South African Airways would bring Emirates closer to the South African market, its 10th largest based on seats. The Qantas partnership covers Emirates\u2019 fourth largest market, Australia, while American Airlines would have covered the US, the third largest.\r\n\r\nEmirates Airlines seat capacity by country: 28-Dec-2015 to 3-Jan-2016\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation and OAG\r\n\r\nMalaysia is not one of Emirates\u2019 10 largest markets, but this Southeast Asian region where Emirates will gain better access is one of its largest regions.\r\n\r\nEmirates seat capacity by region: 28-Dec-2015 to 3-Jan-2016\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation and OAG \r\n\r\nThe TAAG partnership could, at first blush, be seen to be Emirates dabbling with very small partnerships. The Angolan market \u2013 at least prior to the downturn \u2013 was small but lucrative. The partnership developments in Malaysia and potentially South Africa show that Emirates is looking to make friends in markets of importance, but going beyond its handful of key markets (Australia, US) where its previous major partnership efforts were concentrated.\r\nCommercial value and competitors mean that Emirates is changing its stance\r\n\r\n\u201CGo big or go home\u201D \u2013 this is an apt description for Emirates. It tends not to do anything in a small way. It would rather wait and kick off with a strong start than begin with a small presence. \r\n\r\nThis certainly applies to its routes, where less than daily service is unusual; Etihad and Qatar are less concerned by having only a few frequencies a week. It also extends to marketing, where Emirates may be quiet for a period, but will then deliver its pointed Jennifer Aniston commercial, which nearly instantly made headlines. Emirates launched social media with full force rather than dabbling in it.\r\n\r\nThe Qantas partnership was big, and an American Airlines one would have been too, but Emirates is increasingly bowing to flexibility, finding it can benefit from smaller partnerships while not deviating from its business. This is not necessarily a sign that Emirates was wrong in the past but rather it can be agile, and as it enters maturity, at 30 years old, it can think about Life differently.  \r\n\r\nThere are also external factors as its competitors develop and grow partnership strategies, with most of these occurring in recent years. Qatar Airways is taking the traditional partnership path of bilateral agreements and alliance membership (as is the \u201Cfourth\u201D Gulf carrier, Turkish Airlines). Etihad Airways is acquiring typically distressed carriers for strategic and sovereign reasons, forming codeshare partnerships with a number of other carriers.\r\n\r\nForgoing the opportunity to join the oneworld alliance, allowing Qatar Airways to enter, may be a regret for Emirates. Emirates has watched with surprise \u2013 and a degree of annoyance \u2013 as Etihad\u2019s acquisition portfolio grew, and as codeshare partners rapidly increased to be far more than Emirates' partners. Partnership revenue for 2014 accounted for USD1.1 billion, or 24%, of Etihad's passenger revenue.\r\n\r\nForming smaller partnerships may bring benefits to Emirates, and it also now keeps those partners out of Etihad\u2019s reach. Prior to the extensive Emirates partnership announcement, Malaysia Airlines partnered with Etihad. (The future of the Malaysia-Etihad partnership is unclear.) \r\n\r\nSouth African Airways had been seeking a Gulf partner and was weighing offers from Etihad and Emirates. Emirates\u2019 initial offer was limited since it did not think that Etihad was a viable option for SAA, and thus that SAA would not choose Etihad. But SAA did indeed choose Etihad, and launched services to Etihad\u2019s Abu Dhabi hub. This has resulted in Emirates coming back to SAA with a far more competitive offering.\r\nAn overview of Emirates\u2019 existing partnerships\r\n\r\nThere is no overarching matrix to justify Emirates\u2019 current major partnership portfolio (and wish list). Although value is of course the end objective, there are multiple nuances along the way. Below is a brief description of the individual motivations.\r\nQantas\r\n\r\nThe landmark Qantas partnership is what started much alliance\/partnership change \u2013 at Emirates specifically and globally. Crucially, Qantas shifted its European stopover hub from Singapore to Dubai and gained access to Emirates' far wider European, and beyond, network. Emirates saw the Qantas partnership as a necessity since Qantas, despite a far more limited network and forced backtracking through London, was able to have a yield advantage over Emirates because of its local presence and frequent flyer programme. Flying to a Gulf partner's hub has been a feature of some of Etihad's closer partnerships, while beyond flying has not proven as popular.\r\n\r\nSee related report: Qantas and Emirates to codeshare in first alliance shakeup of the season; next: Qatar into oneworld\r\nAmerican Airlines\r\n\r\nAn American Airlines partnership has not materialised, despite the desire, and attempts from Emirates. Similarly to the relationship with Qantas, Emirates wants access to American's customer base, which includes the world's largest frequent flyer programme, AAdvantage. American in fact has a longstanding codeshare with Etihad, and formed a codeshare with Qatar following Qatar's entry to oneworld. American has expanded its Etihad and Qatar partnerships several times since the US Big 3 airlines issued their White Paper against Gulf carriers.\r\n\r\nSee related report: Emirates continues courting American as ink dries on Qantas deal\r\nMalaysia Airlines\r\n\r\nThe Malaysia-Emirates partnership follows from Etihad's interest in Malaysia. Malaysia has been restructuring and cutting its long haul network, particularly to Europe. The Emirates partnership was announced at the same time Malaysia announced that it would end service to Amsterdam and Paris, leaving London as its only online European market. Malaysia is also closing its daily service to Dubai, leaving all Dubai-Kuala Lumpur capacity flown by Emirates. The deal will likely see Emirates place more passengers onto Malaysia's regional Asian network than Malaysia places passengers onto Emirates. The Southeast Asia access that Malaysia will provide to Emirates supplements Emirates' existing Jetstar Asia partnership.\r\n\r\nSee related reports:\r\n\r\n    Malaysia Airlines post restructuring strategy evolves with Emirates partnership, new domestic bases\r\n    Emirates, boosted by Jetstar Asia, will become the largest foreign full service airline in Singapore \r\n\r\nSouth African Airways\r\n\r\nSAA was Emirates' first codeshare partner and the relationship was largely limited until SAA was able to end services to Beijing and Mumbai (two routes deemed strategic by its government owners). SAA sought a Gulf hub partner to facilitate offline access to China and India. SAA solicited both Emirates and Etihad, initially forming a large partnership with Etihad. The Etihad partnership may fade as Emirates \u2013 originally believing SAA would not partner with Etihad \u2013 has brought to the table a far more comprehensive partnership. While this would be smaller in size than Emirates-Qantas, it could go deeper into procurement, including aircraft purchasing, a feature of Etihad's partner network.\r\n\r\nSee related reports:\r\n\r\n    South African Airways seeks UAE stop on Beijing & Mumbai with support from Emirates or Etihad\r\n    South African Airways outlook brightens as recovery plan and partnership strategy roll out\r\n\r\nTAAG\r\n\r\nAnnounced in Oct-2014, the Emirates-TAAG partnership is a small, market-specific partnership covering Angola, where access is limited but the yields are high. Emirates will manage the carrier, and appoint some management, but will not place equity. A lack of ownership stakes is one large difference between Emirates' major partners and Etihad's.\r\n\r\nSee related report: Emirates Airline makes rare partnership move with TAAG in Angola's small but lucrative market\r\nAlaska Airlines, Copa and JetBlue\r\n\r\nThese three are market-specific partnerships. The partners do not fly to Dubai or cooperate on any long haul routes (having none) although JetBlue does codeshare on Emirates' network.\r\n\r\nJetBlue provides access at JFK, which Emirates has been able to grow because of the feed to\/from JetBlue (similar to Emirates-Jetstar Asia in Singapore). JetBlue also contributes in other Emirates destinations, including Boston and Orlando.\r\n\r\nAlaska is a growing partnership to cover Seattle and the Pacific Northwest, as well as parts of Canada, where Emirates cannot secure more traffic rights, and the partnership has seen Emirates grow Seattle capacity.\r\n\r\nCopa is a new partnership and takes form in 2016 as Emirates plans to commence service to Copa's Panama City hub (Dubai-Panama City will become the world's longest route). Copa will provide access to Central and South America, markets that are either too thin for non-stop service, or have operational challenges that preclude non-stop service. Codeshare flights on Copa have taken longer than expected and delayed Emirates' Panama City launch.\r\n\r\nSee related report: Emirates' USA growth anchored around JetBlue and Alaska Air hubs. Panama City for LatAm Growth\r\nEmirates is finally growing in China: Yinchuan and Zhengzhou are the next destinations\r\n\r\nGulf carriers are underrepresented in China. Where Gulf carriers have such small presences \u2013 not just in China but also in Canada and Korea \u2013 it is because of bilateral restrictions. There has been little change in the number of average daily Gulf carrier flights into mainland China between 2012 (11) and 2015 (12).\r\n\r\nTo put this in perspective, in 2005 Gulf carriers had more flights into China (1.9 a day on average) than the US (1.1 a day). With the benefit of open skies, Gulf carrier flights into the US are growing from 1.1 to 32 in 2016. The China market, once larger than the US for Gulf carriers, is now one third the size. Over a 10-year period, there has been larger frequency growth to China than India, but this is from a low base.\r\n\r\nLooking at changes since 2012, Gulf carriers\u2019 Indian flights have increased 34% compared to their Chinese flights growing 17%. Protectionist-inclined India is the well-cited bane of Gulf carriers, but in perspective China appears generous. In recent years India has moved away from being the Gulf carriers\u2019 main source of bilateral antagonism; Canada, China and Korea have joined the mix.\r\n\r\nGulf carriers' flights into China have plateaued in recent years. This is in contrast to European and US carriers accelerating growth.\r\n\r\nAverage daily flights into China from airlines based in Europe and the US compared with Emirates\/Etihad\/Qatar: 2005-2016\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation and OAG\r\n\r\nEmirates has not increased its China flights since 2009, which followed a period of introducing a new daily service to Guangzhou and then a second daily service to each Beijing and Shanghai. Guangzhou\u2019s addition in 2008 was the last new point in China.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, Etihad added Chengdu in 2011, while Qatar added Chongqing in 2011, and then Chengdu and Hangzhou in 2013.\r\n\r\nAverage daily flights to China from Emirates, Etihad and Qatar: 2005-2016\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation and OAG\r\n\r\nAlthough Emirates is the largest Gulf carrier in China by seat capacity (and, to a lesser extent, frequency) it is Qatar that has the widest destination footprint, with six points in 2015 compared with Emirates\u2019 three. Although Qatar's may be wider in terms of points, Emirates\u2019 double daily to Beijing and Shanghai are surely more valuable than additional points.\r\n\r\nEmirates has been able to upgauge Beijing and Shanghai to A380, but in the murky world of bilateral negotiations it has not been able to upgauge Guangzhou or add new points. Emirates has not grown frequency since 2008, and bilateral negotiations, including those in 2013, have produced no growth outcomes.\r\n\r\nChina to Middle East (seats per week, one way): 2011-2015\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation and OAG \r\n\r\nLocal versus national aviation aspirations constantly play out in China: locally, each city or region wants its own airline. Nationally, the CAAC would prefer consolidation. With Gulf carriers, there are plenty of Chinese cities, of various sizes, that lobby Gulf carriers for service. Some could plausibly receive Gulf service but have been unable to persuade the central government to grant more traffic rights. A common refrain is that Gulf carriers are welcome to serve new Chinese cities, but to do so they would have to remove a frequency from their existing network, namely Beijing and Shanghai, which they would certainly not do.\r\n\r\nAfter six years of no frequency increases, there has been a bilateral breakthrough. The exact details and reasons remain publicly unclear, but it is understood to be momentous. Emirates has announced a new four per week service to Yinchuan and Zhengzhou, with Zhengzhou tagged in both directions with Yinchuan.\r\n\r\nYinchuan is the capital of China-Arab relations and already has two weekly flights to Dubai by Sichuan Airlines; the service originates in Chengdu, Sichuan Airlines' hub. Although load factors may be strong, yields are weak. China is ramping up efforts to develop its national strategies of \u201COne Belt, One Road\u201D and the \u201CMaritime Silk Road\u201D.\r\n\r\nConveniently for the Gulf carriers, their homes are part of this geography. Many of their connecting markets have no viable connections to\/from China other than a Gulf hub. Emirates in particular has pursued this strategy, noting its current and potential role in China\u2019s strategies.\r\n\r\nThis is in addition to China\u2019s longer-running effort to develop a larger presence on the African continent, which presents only limited opportunities for Chinese carriers. China-Africa is a large traffic flow for Gulf carriers; Emirates says 22% of its China passengers connect to Africa.\r\n\r\nSee related reports: \r\n\r\n    China's airlines pivot towards Africa, after making inroads in Europe, North America and Australia\r\n    Air China's entry into Addis Ababa and Johannesburg would further China's objectives in Africa\r\n    HNA\/Hainan Airlines buys 6.2% of South Africa's Comair, accelerating China-Africa aviation links\r\n\r\nEmirates' facilitation of China's Belt and Road Links: Dec-2015\r\n\r\nSource: Emirates\r\n\r\nDestinations served by Emirates and Chinese carriers along the Belt and Road route: Dec-2015\r\n\r\nSource: Emirates\r\n\r\nIn short, it was time for China to match speech with actions.\r\n\r\nThere are likely to be other factors too. One could be a deliberate effort to have Chinese carriers improve their proposition; historically, the CAAC has intentionally allowed foreign competition that in the short term diluted the strength of local carriers - but then cajoled them to be more competitive, with long term benefits. Gulf carrier competition could be more palatable amid efforts to introduce some transparency in Chinese aviation, and to remove corruption.\r\n\r\nAs China experiences bilateral antagonism with European nations and the US, granting Gulf carriers traffic rights could be seen as leverage, even though Gulf carriers have limited overlap in China with European carriers and hardly any with US carriers (connections via the Gulf are too circuitous). There are still Europe connections on Gulf carriers\u2019 Chinese flights.\r\n\r\nThe China-Europe market has become more competitive following significant growth, especially from secondary markets where flights are sustained through subsidies and tour operators. Low fuel costs currently enable the China-Europe non-stop services to continue, but an increase could see them taper off until more demand builds.\r\n\r\nIn a scenario where higher fuel prices would force them off some of these secondary routes, Gulf carriers have advantages sustaining their secondary China routes since they are shorter than a Europe-China flight. A secondary flight between Europe and China is more demanding to make profitable, given limited connections and very limited premium demand. Gulf carriers will be able to rely on the rest of their network, and while they may also find limited premium demand, that will impact a six or seven hour flight, not a 10 hour flight.\r\n\r\nZhengzhou has no Gulf carrier service, or in fact any intercontinental passenger flights. Cargo services are plentiful: Zhengzhou is a major manufacturing city, including for Foxconn, Apple\u2019s main contractor. The high output of consumer electronics requires air freight. Henan province, of which Zhengzhou is the capital, has invested in Luxembourg freight operator Cargolux.\r\n\r\nCargolux flies to Zhengzhou, and beyond to points in Asia and North America, giving it access to the lucrative Asia-North America freight lane. China Southern operates direct from Zhengzhou to Los Angeles , while there are other freight services, including 747s from Cathay Pacific.\r\n\r\nSee related reports:\r\n\r\n    China's secondary airlines plan long haul growth. 10 airlines to have widebody aircraft. Part 1\r\n    Zhengzhou aims to be an aviation hub in China, complete with Cargolux and two startup airlines\r\n    Chinese air cargo shifts from Shanghai to the Three Cs: Chengdu, Chongqing and CGO\r\n\r\nYinchuan and Zhengzhou are not primary or even secondary markets for Emirates. Yinchuan has political significance while the Zhengzhou tag will help pump cargo into the 777-200LR\u2019s spacious belly, more so with potentially light passenger loads. The routes are a sign of commitment to China\u2019s national aviation development and long term opportunities. More immediately, they are expected to be followed with service to additional Chinese cities.\r\n\r\nThose additional points are expected to be more familiar secondary cities, such as the ones that European carriers are serving, and Chinese carriers are increasingly launching intercontinental service from.\r\n\r\nEmirates has not stated any China growth plans beyond Yinchuan and Zhengzhou, but it is not far-fetched to think that in a short time Emirates could double its number of China flights. Even then opportunities will be missed due to restrictions, protectionism (limiting A380 service) and slots. Overall, this is still a very welcome, and overdue, start.\r\nA350\/787 order will allow Emirates to reach thinner markets\r\n\r\nIn the pipeline for some years has been an order for medium-sized widebodies. Their need was apparent some time ago: Emirates ordered A350s and then cancelled them as specifications changed. Emirates has said it expects to make a decision in 2016 between the A350 and 787 for its medium-sized widebody needs. \r\n\r\nThe use for a medium-size widebody aircraft is evident. Looking at the composition of the fleets of the three Gulf network carriers, Emirates is heavily reliant on large and very large aircraft, A380 and 777-300ER, which make up 79% of its fleet. A comparison with Etihad and Qatar is skewed, since Emirates does not operate narrowbody aircraft.\r\n\r\n737 operator FlyDubai fulfills many of the Dubai market\u2019s narrowbody aircraft needs. Although not directly affiliated with Emirates, it has the same shareholder. Flydubai is arguably close to being the narrowbody operation of Emirates. Even if FlyDubai\u2019s narrowbody fleet is included with Emirates', Emirates\u2019 large and very large aircraft represent 65% of the combined fleet, compared with 34% at Etihad, and 25% at Qatar. While Etihad and Qatar may have differences between them, they are closer to each other than to Emirates. \r\n\r\nEmirates (including\/excluding FlyDubai), Etihad and Qatar fleet by aircraft type: 21-Dec-2015\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA Fleet Database\r\n\r\nLooking only at widebody aircraft across the three airlines, medium sized widebodies make up 21% of Emirates\u2019 fleet compared with 51% at Etihad, and 63% at Qatar.\r\n\r\nEmirates, Etihad and Qatar widebody fleet by aircraft type: 21-Dec-2015\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA Fleet Database\r\n\r\nThe large scale of Emirates\u2019 operation can only partially justify such a significant reliance on large aircraft. Emirates has more 777-300ERs and A380s than Etihad and Qatar have passenger aircraft in their entire fleet.\r\n\r\nEmirates has almost as many widebody passenger aircraft as Etihad's and Qatar's combined. This significant number of large aircraft enables feed across a network where approximately 80% of traffic is connecting; it takes an A380 to feed an A380.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there are thinner markets that currently cannot be accessed with one of these large aircraft, even if there is such significant feed elsewhere on the network to try to support the destination. There are also destinations currently served by large aircraft that would be better served by a smaller widebody, in line with a small downgauging trend observed at other airlines (from 747-400 to 777-300ER, from 777-200ER to 787). Finally, a smaller widebody will replace Emirates\u2019 existing medium-sized widebody aircraft (mostly A330s) that are in need of replacement.\r\nOutlook: sceptics ask if Gulf growth is ending, but a different era is beginning\r\n\r\nFor the Gulf carriers China brings a welcome change to aeropolitical matters. Canada, India and Korea are still notable challenges. Despite the noise around US carriers requesting a revision to US-UAE\/Qatar open skies, change seems unlikely. Europe\u2019s new aviation policy promises later commentary on \u201Cfair competition\u201D. Like the US talk, this may also not go anywhere, but unlike the situation in the US, traffic rights are already restricted in key markets (notably France and Germany). \r\n\r\nSee related reports: New EU Aviation Strategy avoids key issues as Asia Pacific and Middle East claim the future\r\n\r\n2016 will see Emirates further roll out its two-class A380 service. Bangkok, Copenhagen and Kuala Lumpur were initially announced and have been followed with Birmingham, Prague and Taipei. There are sceptics (even within Emirates) of this A380 sub-fleet, to say nothing of those who have long questioned the role of the A380. Emirates may demonstrate it can find sufficient markets for 15 two-class A380s. Alternatively it may find there are more opportunities and grow the sub-fleet. Still within the aircraft realm, Emirates has flagged 2016 for the unveiling of its new business and first class cabins. The design and style, it quietly concedes, are due for an update.\r\n\r\nSee related report: A380 fleet profile: Emirates prepares for 615 seat configuration. SIA will dispose of early models\r\n\r\nA calm Dubai Airshow in Nov-2015, coupled with financials showing, some argued, lower benefit from reduced fuel prices compared with peers or passing too many of the savings onto consumers, provoked some industry observers to ask if the Gulf carriers had passed their prime. This could hardly be the case. The outcomes of the 2013 Dubai Airshow were unlikely to be outstripped in 2015. With the existing aircraft backlog there is not need for significant growth. And there is no rule that aircraft orders have to be announced at airshows (Gulf carriers in 2015 announced top-up orders, but not at the Dubai Airshow).\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons for varying financial performance: revenues are down as the dollar strengthens, fuel savings have been passed on to consumers, and Gulf carriers have \u201Cstrategic\u201D (market share) priorities at present that need time to mature. Qatar will at last achieve its long overdue sought for growth to Australia and the US, and Etihad is looking to bed down developments after its significant acquisitions of Alitalia and Jet Airways. The opening of Etihad's new Abu Dhabi terminal in late 2017 is increasingly within reach.\r\n\r\nSee related reports:\r\n\r\n    Qatar Airways to fly to Sydney as bilateral is relaxed. It will need on-carriage & Doha connections\r\n    Emirates and Qatar Airways announce new US services - for commercial as well as strategic reasons\r\n\r\nForesight, proactive investment and facilitating aviation growth continue to define the strategies of the UAE and Qatar. As Gulf carriers enter new phases and become stronger and smarter, many competitors will still fail to grasp the fundamentals. The standard claim of needing to protect the status quo has in some cases helped delay the inevitable, but market forces and strategic ingenuity are chipping away at the old order."},

	"text":" New York, February 26, 2016 -- Moody's Investors Service (Moody's) upgraded the corporate family rating (CFR) of Emerald Expositions Holding, Inc. (Emerald) to B2 from B3. The first lien credit facility was upgraded to B1 from B2 and the senior unsecured notes were upgraded to Caa1 from Caa2. The outlook was changed to stable from positive.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade reflects the substantial deleveraging of its balance sheet to 5.4x as of YE 2015 from 6.6x at YE 2014 (including Moody's adjustments). Leverage has decreased from a combination of debt repayment and EBITDA gains from both organic growth as well as from acquisitions. The company benefits from strong free cash flow that could be used to fund additional acquisitions or debt repayment going forward.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of Moody's ratings actions:\r\n\r\nIssuer: Emerald Expositions Holding, Inc.\r\n\r\n..Outlook, changed to stable from positive\r\n\r\n..Corporate Family Rating, upgraded to B2 from B3\r\n\r\n..Probability of Default Rating, upgraded to B2-PD from B3-PD\r\n\r\n..US$90mm Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility, upgraded to B1 (LGD3) from B2 (LGD3)\r\n\r\n..US$630mm Senior Secured 1st Lien Term Loan B, upgraded to B1 (LGD3) from B2 (LGD3)\r\n\r\n..US$200mm Senior Unsecured Notes, upgraded to Caa1 (LGD5) from Caa2 (LGD5)\r\n\r\nRATINGS RATIONALE\r\n\r\nEmerald's B2 CFR reflects its leverage of 5.4x (including Moody's standard adjustments) as of YE 2015 and the highly cyclical nature of the tradeshow business. The company operates in ten different end markets although there is a significant concentration to both the Gift, Home, General Merchandise & Manufacturing and Sports & Apparel divisions. In addition, approximately 37% of 2015 revenue was derived from its top five shows. There is also sensitivity to long term disruptions in air travel which would negatively impact performance. The company generates over 90% of revenue from tradeshows and conferences with the remaining revenue coming from lower margin print publications and digital products lines. The limited print exposure which is in secular decline, reduces the risk of converting print revenue to digital that has been a challenge for many companies. Emerald also benefits from high margins, strong free cash flows, a good liquidity position, and growth in the event business following the 2008-2009 recession. Leverage has improved from material debt repayment in 2014 and 2015 as well as from organic EBITDA growth and from acquisitions.\r\n\r\nMoody's anticipates that Emerald will have good liquidity over the next 12 months, supported by strong free cash flow, a cash balance of $16 million as of Q4 2015 and an undrawn $90 million revolver due June 2018. The term loans are covenant lite and the revolver is subject to a 6x net first lien leverage test if the revolver is more than 25% drawn.\r\n\r\nThe company has the ability to incur incremental secured debt in the amount so that the total net first lien secured ratio does not exceed 4.5x plus $100 million. The $200 million senior notes due 2021 become callable on June 15th 2016 at 104.5.\r\n\r\nThe stable outlook reflects Moody's expectation that Emerald will continue to generate good free cash flow and grow revenue in the low single digits. EBITDA growth is expected to lead to modest deleveraging over the next year, although financial policy is anticipated to have a significant impact and could lead to additional deleveraging.\r\n\r\nAn additional upgrade is unlikely in the near term given the recent upgrade. Moody's could upgrade the ratings if the company maintains good liquidity, generates a strong free cash flow to debt ratio of over 15%, and grows EBITDA or reduces debt such that leverage is sustained below 4x. Confidence that the private equity owners would maintain leverage below 4x would also be required as would positive organic revenue growth.\r\n\r\nMoody's could lower the ratings if leverage is sustained above 5.75x due to economic weakness, poor operating performance, or a debt funded shareholder friendly transaction. Negative free cash flow or a weak liquidity position would also lead to negative rating pressure.\r\n\r\nThe principal methodology used in these ratings was Business and Consumer Service Industry published in December 2014. Please see the Ratings Methodologies page on www.moodys.com for a copy of this methodology.\r\n\r\nEmerald Expositions Holding, Inc. (Emerald) (fka Nielsen Business Media Holding Company) is one of the leading operators of business-to-business event and tradeshows. The company operates tradeshows in ten end markets (Gift, Home, General Merchandise & Manufacturing; Sports & Apparel; Design; Jewelry, Luxury & Antiques; eCommerce; Creative Services; Licensing; Healthcare; Military; and Food). In June 2013, investment funds managed by an affiliate of Onex Partners Manager LP (Onex) acquired the company from the Nielsen Company for $949 million.

Ball is currently seeking approval for the deal from US competition authorities.\r\n\r\n\u201CIt\u2019s a lot of divestitures. They have to sell [assets equivalent to] 40 per cent or potentially more of what they\u2019re acquiring \u2014 that\u2019s a big deal,\u201D says Mark Wilde, analyst at BMO Capital.\r\n\r\nAccording to people familiar with the plans, the assets for sale generated $420m in earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation last year. That amount is equivalent to more than one-fifth of analyst expectations for the two groups\u2019 total in 2016, according to Bloomberg data.\r\n\r\nDespite the size of the disposals needed, Ball\u2019s management has been unwavering in its commitment to the transaction, according to people close to the deal. Its move for Rexam will merge two of the three leaders in the global canning industry, giving the combined company significant scale.\r\n\r\nAccording to estimates by analysts at Baird, the new entity would have almost half the market share in North America; 39 per cent in Europe; and 57 per cent in Brazil. It would also own a superior portfolio of manufacturing facilities that combines the companies\u2019 complementary geographical footprints.\r\n\r\n\u201CRexam has better exposure to the more growing geographies and specialty cans,\u201D says Chip Dillon, analyst at Vertical Research Partners. \u201CThe growth and future is multiple can sizes and varieties, as opposed to the standard can.\u201D\r\n\r\nFor example, the UK group is strong in emerging markets such as Brazil, Russia, India and the Middle East, while Ball has a presence in China, Vietnam and Myanmar. A greater geographical spread could help offset the decline of sweet carbonated drinks in Ball\u2019s home US market, as well.\r\n\r\nPressure to consolidate has also intensified from customers. Since the Ball-Rexam tie-up was announced a year ago, AB InBev launched the world\u2019s biggest brewing takeover with a \u00A371bn bid for its rival SABMiller.\r\n\r\n\u201CThis merger is both offensive and defensive,\u201D argues Ghansham Panjabi of Baird. \u201CThey see customers getting bigger\u2009.\u2009.\u2009.\u2009and the point is to make sure they won\u2019t get bullied by them in the long term\u201D.\r\n\r\nPeople close to Ball have argued that a deal will allow the merged company to pass along some of the estimated \u00A3300m in annual cost savings to its customers, which will include drinks companies such as PepsiCo, AB InBev and Red Bull. But others have questioned whether a reduction in competition can be good in the long term.\r\n\r\nLast month, Ball agreed to sell off 10 European factories \u2014 most of its metal beverage packaging operations there \u2014 as well as two Rexam plants. Two plants will be sold in Brazil and final clearance from the US Federal Trade Commission is expected before the end of June, subject to further divestitures. Such will be the size of the disposals that they will instantly rank as the third biggest competitor in the sector.\r\n\r\nRecent progress with regulators seems to be winning over investors, who are displaying increased confidence that the deal will complete: the spread between Ball\u2019s offer price and where Rexam shares are trading has narrowed from around 13 per cent in October to just 3 per cent this week.\r\n\r\nAnd the price of walking away remains steep. A break fee payable to Rexam is equal to about 7 per cent of the deal value, or around \u00A3300m \u2014 higher than the usual amount acquirer\u2019s commit to in deals.\r\n\r\n\u201CHigh break-fees like this are there when the target cannot see its way through the regulatory process,\u201D say analysts at Olivetree Securities. \u201CThis is a classic example. Rexam has done a good job protection its shareholders given the likelihood of a complicated antitrust process.\u201D\r\n\r\nAlong with US approvals, a remaining concern is how much value Ball can extract from its disposals. Smaller rivals and private equity funds are circling. Buyout groups as Apollo and Onex already own assets in adjacent industries, while other firms including Blackstone and CVC would like to enter the market.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe wild card is the multiple [of earnings] they will get for the plants they\u2019re going to sell,\u201D says Mr Wilde.\r\n"},

	"text":"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Drinks can makers Ball Corp (BLL.N) and Rexam Plc REX.L have begun the process of selling assets, potentially worth more than $3 billion, to meet antitrust regulations ahead of their planned merger, several people familiar with the matter said.\r\nAluminum cans are seen at the assembly line of Rexam Beverage Can in Jacarei, Brazil, June 25, 2015. REUTERS\/Paulo Whitaker\r\n\r\nBoth companies are expected to meet with representatives of buyout groups Blackstone (BX.N), Apollo (APO.N), CVC, Onex OCX.TO and Madison Dearborn, as well as with peers Silgan (SLGN.O) and Ardagh, before final bids are due in mid-March, the sources said.\r\n\r\nU.S.-based Ball\u2019s planned 4.4-billion-pound ($6.4 billion) takeover of Britain\u2019s Rexam will merge the world\u2019s two largest beverage can makers by volume - which supply Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and Anheuser-Busch InBev (ABI.BR) - and should improve efficiency and cut costs. However, the deal triggered concerns in the European Commission that it would drive up prices for companies and consumers.\r\n\r\nBall said last week that it expects to close the merger in the first half of 2016, after receiving conditional regulatory clearance in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe two companies have offered to sell 12 plants across Europe, 10 of which make cans and two produce can ends. Four of the factories are in Germany and three in Britain. Separately, Ball is selling about eight sites in the United States and several in Brazil, also due to antitrust concerns.\r\n\r\nBall and Rexam as well as the potential bidders either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment.\r\n\r\nThe assets on the block are expected to post $420 million in annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization this year and may be valued at up to eight to nine times that in any potential deals, the sources said.\r\n\r\nPeers trade at an average multiple of nine times their expected core earnings.\r\n\r\nWhile strategic players are often able to outbid private equity groups in auction processes due to their ability to reap synergies from a merger, the buyout groups may have an edge in this sale: speed.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe seller needs to have security that the deal goes through smoothly to make the bigger merger work. And companies like Silgan may have antitrust issues of their own, which could delay any deal,\u201D one of the sources aid.\r\n\r\nThe source added that in Ardagh\u2019s case, debt levels may be an issue. The Ireland-based group last year pulled a planned initial public offering of its cans business, which would have reduced its 4.8 billion euros of net debt, and it may now shy away from taking on too much additional leverage to finance another acquisition.\r\n\r\n($1 = 0.6975 pounds) "},

	"text":"\r\n\r\nAnita Anand is the J.R. Kimber Chair in Investor Protection and Corporate Governance at the University of Toronto law faculty.\r\n\r\nDual-class share structures are fundamentally unfair: They leave the subordinate shareholders unprotected and cry out for a response from securities regulators. Proponents of such structures call up the success stories \u2013 Fairfax, Onex \u2013 but rarely do they focus on the incontrovertible truth that dual-class share structures undermine corporate-governance standards because the subordinate shareholders carry a lopsided share of economic risk relative to their ability to influence the corporation's affairs.\r\n\r\nIn particular, these shareholders cannot elect directors, approve financial statements, appoint auditors or ensure change through their vote. Their rights are meaningless in the face of the proportionately greater risk they bear. Dual-class structures thus undermine existing accountability mechanisms in the corporate statute. Because the jurisdiction of securities regulators is founded on investor protection and the public interest, dual-class structures should be further regulated, if not prohibited, in capital markets.\r\n\r\nWhy? Dual-class firms, and the holders of the superior voting shares, should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of going public without the commensurate economic burden. A primary purpose of going public is to give the corporation access to funding from the public at large. It is unfair to allow corporations to enjoy these benefits without also taking on the corresponding burden of adequate protection for public shareholders.\r\n\r\nProponents of dual-class structures use a \"caveat emptor\" argument: Investors are not unfairly treated given the disclosure to which they are entitled, including information about the firm's capital structure. While non-voting shares have their drawbacks, there is a price at which the market is willing to accept the drawbacks.\r\n\r\nBut dual-class structures insulate management and the board. They are detrimental to outside shareholders because they undermine accountability mechanisms built into the corporate statute, including the ability to elect directors. Shareholders carry the financial risk without the corresponding voting power to alter the board or effect change.\r\n\r\nIn short, dual-class structures favour insiders who have fewer checks on self-dealing and an unfettered ability to define executive pay, bonuses and stock-option plans. They preclude subordinate shareholders from mounting successful challenges to the leadership of a public corporation as well as fundamental changes that it seeks to implement. They therefore open the door to entrenchment, allowing senior officers and directors to shirk their duties or divert profits.\r\n\r\nPresumably, dual-class structures are permitted because they represent free contracting between investors and the firm. But the relationship is not simply contractual; it has a securities regulatory overlay premised on the principle of investor protection. As the Supreme Court of Canada has held, securities regulators have a duty to act in the public interest and to protect the public on a prospective and preventive basis. When put into practice, this mandate does not allow securities regulators to overlook acts of the public corporation that silence investors by preventing them from participating in corporate decision-making. Securities commissions must, then, do more to protect subordinate shareholders in dual-class firms.\r\n\r\nIf securities regulators are unwilling to ban dual-class shares altogether, they should consider the following options.\r\n\r\nFirst, regulators should require that issuers subject their dual-class structures to a sunset provision. Once a company goes public, the structure would be permitted to remain in place only for a limited time unless subordinate shareholders vote to retain it.\r\n\r\nSecond, recalling the controversial collapse of the dual-class share structure in Magna International Inc., regulators should subject the terms of any buyout of the dual-class firm to procedural safeguards, including a majority of the minority vote, a fairness opinion and a mandatory recommendation of a special committee of the board formed for the purpose of evaluating the transaction.\r\n\r\nFinally, in change-of-control transactions, regulators should ensure that, at a minimum, all shareholders have a number of votes proportionate to their economic interests. A similar rule is warranted in the case of changes of control by means other than a takeover bid, such as a proxy contest.\r\n\r\nRemember, not all dual-class firms are run as well as Fairfax and Onex \u2013 take Bombardier. Reforms are needed to ensure that all shareholders remain on a one-to-one footing regardless of the proposed change-of-control transaction and the means by which it occurs. That would be a good start.\r\n"}]},

	"text":"BlackRock Inc.\u2019s Jason Miller has fielded more calls from Japanese investors in the past few weeks than ever in recent memory. Among the main concern for clients: How can they safeguard returns in a new era of below-zero rates?\r\n\r\nMiller, who heads BlackRock\u2019s exchange-traded fund unit in Japan, is not alone in grappling with a new reality for the nation\u2019s money managers. Diam Co., which manages $144 billion, said it has been conducting daily internal meetings since the Bank of Japan made its announcement Jan. 29 to discuss new ways to eke out returns. Japan Post Insurance Co., the nation\u2019s largest insurer, said it may seek to replace low-yielding Japanese bonds with foreign holdings.\r\n\r\nThe BOJ\u2019s surprise decision to move to a negative-rate policy has roiled the nation\u2019s $14.1 billion money-market fund industry, with the 11 main firms in the business halting new investments into their funds. Managers with the flexibility to invest across asset classes may accelerate a shift away from domestic government bonds with yields on 10-year debt hovering near record lows below zero.\r\n\r\n\u201CI would expect the negative-rate decision to increase the longer-term trend that has been apparent around a shift by fixed income investors out of JGBs,\u201D Miller said, referring to the Japanese government bonds.\r\n\r\nInvestment managers have halved the proportion of assets they hold in domestic bonds to 15 percent over the past five years, according to data as of Sept. 30 from the Japan Investment Advisers Association.\r\n\r\nThe yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond closed unchanged at minus 0.06 on Thursday.\r\n\r\nInvestors around the world have had to seek novel ways to boost returns since the European Central Bank enforced negative interest rates in June 2014, and countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark have also cut rates below zero to jump-start growth. For money managers seeking to balance high returns with less risk, it has been a struggle to find investments amid slowing global growth, rising market volatility and declining yields for bonds.\r\n\r\nDiam is considering buying foreign debt, though negative rates in other markets around the world and currency risks are posing a challenge, President and Chief Executive Officer Yasumasa Nishi said in an interview.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are debating whether we should start investing in foreign debt with currency hedges,\u201D he said. \u201CThat would leave us the U.S. market because there\u2019s negative rates in Europe as well. Our choice becomes limited.\u201D\r\n\r\nAt BlackRock\u2019s Japan unit, some of the products investors are seeking to boost returns include real estate investment trusts and global credit products, said Miller. BlackRock is also noticing a shift into U.S. Treasuries, he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs a firm, we are thinking about near-term and longer-term solutions,\u201D Miller said. \u201CIt\u2019s been a very active two weeks for us. It\u2019s creating a significant amount of dialogue across a broad range of investors.\u201D\r\n\r\nMizuho Financial Group Inc. plans to boost staff for underwriting debt as the negative rates policy drives investors to seek riskier notes such as capital-boosting securities. While companies may favor loans over bonds after the BOJ penalized banks for holding cash, sovereign yields below zero will force investors to consider new fixed-income assets, according to Yutaka Fukushi, the head of global capital markets at Mizuho Securities Co.\r\n\r\nNomura Asset Management Co. and Daiwa Asset Management Co. are among 11 managers of money funds that have stopped accepting investments in a move that spells the end to the industry in its current form. Money reserve funds, which are pools used by brokerages to park their cash, are also under pressure. Japan Securities Dealers Association Chairman Kazutoshi Inano said his group has asked the Bank of Japan to exclude money reserved funds from the negative rate, and has not yet received any response.\r\n\r\nAmong the most vulnerable investors to negative rates are the Japanese insurers that rely on their Japanese government bond holdings to meet insurance payouts. The Life Insurance Association of Japan, a group consisting of 41 insurers, said that negative interest rates make it difficult for the nation\u2019s insurers to manage their assets and products. About half of the insurers\u2019 $2.67 trillion in assets is invested in Japanese government bonds, according to the association.\r\n\r\nEnsuring the payout \u201Chas been our mission and at the current level of interest rates, it would be difficult to manage assets that focus on Japanese government bonds,\u201D said Yoshinobu Tsutsui, chairman of the Life Insurance Association of Japan and president of Nippon Life Insurance Co., Japan\u2019s biggest life insurer. \u201CIt\u2019s unavoidable that we will see a shift to foreign debt.\u201D\r\n\r\nJapan Post Insurance plans to lift its allocation to stocks and foreign debt to 10 percent of the portfolio by March 2018 from 6.4 percent as of December, President Masami Ishii said in an interview.\r\n\r\nWith stock markets around the world plunging this year because of concerns about slowing growth and elevated volatility, equities might not be the most obvious choice for risk-averse investors. Japan\u2019s Topix index has tumbled 9.8 percent since the BOJ decision on Jan. 29, compared with a 0.3 percent decline for MSCI World Index.\r\n\r\nStill, to Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA Ltd. in Tokyo, the declines have made Japan\u2019s stock markets more attractive. He said the probability of an increase in the nation\u2019s equities is a lot higher at these valuation levels. Topix stocks are trading near the lowest price-to-earnings ratios since October 2014.\r\n\r\n\u201CIf you are a fund manager and you have a majority of money in bonds and very little in equities, then run, don\u2019t walk,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CYou need to get out of the bonds and start moving into equities.\u201D"},

Nomura, Nikko and Daiwa are among those that have turned clients away.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe ultimate survival of the Japanese money market fund industry is in jeopardy,\u201D says Vanessa Robert, senior credit officer at Moody\u2019s.\r\n\r\nJapanese asset managers have appealed to the central bank for a special exemption from negative rates in order to overcome their problems.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Ms Robert says, these fund companies will \u201Cquickly run out of viable options\u201D to ensure that investors\u2019 capital remains secure.\r\n\r\nAround Y2tn ($17bn) is held in money market funds in Japan and a further $100bn is in similar money reserve funds, which can invest in higher-yielding foreign-currency securities.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Japanese industry is relatively small compared with the US and Europe, where trillions of dollars are invested in comparable funds, analysts have looked to Europe for guidance. European money funds have been hit by negative rates for almost two years.\r\n\r\n\u201CEuropean money market funds faced widespread, and in some cases severe, outflows when their yields turned negative,\u201D says Alastair Sewell, a director at Fitch, the rating agency.\r\n\r\nHe says money did eventually return to this type of fund, but only because investors \u201Cfailed to find palatable, positive-yielding alternatives\u201D.\r\n\r\nThe worry is that investment flows are likely to become more volatile in Japan, according to Mr Sewell. He believes the smaller asset base of Japanese money market funds means they are less likely to retain sufficient cash to remain viable.\r\n\r\nY2tn ($17bn)\r\n\r\nAmount held in money market funds in Japan. A further $100bn is in similar money reserve funds\r\n\r\nThe investor base in Japan is much smaller and the variety of products much leaner than in Europe, which could heighten problems.\r\n\r\nMs Robert adds that European asset managers were quick to adopt new \u201Cflex\u201D mechanisms that allowed them to maintain a constant \u20AC1-a-share net asset value even when short-term yields were negative. Flex mechanisms permit managers to cancel or redeem share classes if yields remain negative.\r\n\r\nBut because the Japanese government\u2019s introduction of negative rates was so swift and took asset managers by surprise, they have not had time to develop similar solutions. It is also unclear if such arrangements would be acceptable.\r\n\r\n\u201CSolutions that surfaced in Europe to deal with negative rates are unlikely to be accepted in Japan,\u201D says Ms Robert.\r\n\r\nSome are more optimistic about the fate of Japan\u2019s money funds.\r\n\r\nJason Granet, head of international cash portfolio management at Goldman Sachs, the US bank, says: \u201CNegative rates will not spell the end for Japanese money funds. But investors will recalibrate their expectations for returns on cash.\u201D\r\n\r\nMr Granet points out that the Dublin-domiciled yen money market fund run by Goldman Sachs has operated with negative rates for more than a year and has continued to attract positive inflows from investors.\r\n\r\nHe adds that Goldman has not weakened credit standards or attempted to hold riskier assets to boost the returns of its money funds. \u201COur focus remains on liquidity and the preservation of capital. Safety still rules at the end of the day,\u201D says Mr Granet.\r\n"},

	"text":"Occupancy rates went up at Macau hotels of every category during the Chinese New Year Golden Week holiday, compared to the prior-year holiday period. But room rates fell in all hotel categories, indicated a Tuesday press release from the Macao Government Tourism Office.\r\n\r\nThe average room rate for three- to five-star hotels in Macau dropped 17.2 percent to approximately MOP1,673 (US$209) in the holiday season from February 7 to 13 inclusive, said the tourism office.\r\n\r\nFor five-star hotels, many of them located in the city\u2019s casino resorts, the average room rate went down 12.2 percent to approximately MOP2,151.\r\n\r\nFour-star rates were down 15.7 percent on those for the 2015 holiday season, to approximately MOP1,456. Three-star room prices declined 25 percent to MOP1,412, while those in two-star accommodation were down 9.1 percent to approximately MOP982.\r\n\r\nOnly guest house rooms showed a slight improvement in rates compared to the prior-year holiday period, up 1.7 percent to MOP738.\r\n\r\nThe tourism office said that as of this week, there were a total of 33,047 rooms of all types in the Macau hotel and guest house market.\r\n\r\nCiting \u201Cindustry figures\u201D the office said that three- to five-star hotels registered an average occupancy rate of 93.4 percent during February\u2019s week-long holiday period, a year-on-year increase of 5.9 percentage points.\r\n\r\nFive-star hotels recorded an average occupancy rate of 96.2 percent, up 2.9 percentage points; four-star hotels registered 92.6 percent occupancy, up 8.5 percentage points; three-star hotels 91.4 percent, up 6.2 percentage points; and two-star hotels 78.7 percent, up 4.8 percentage points.\r\n\r\nGuest house occupancy was 75.6 percent, up slightly by 1.6 percentage points.\r\n\r\n\u201CVery tight supply of hotel rooms continued over the entire course of the peak season, partially due to a very early bulk selling of hotel rooms to travel agents. As a result, a number of junket operators indicated their inability to obtain requested allocation of hotel room from the casino operators,\u201D said analysts at Daiwa Securities Group Inc in a note on Monday.\r\n\r\nPreliminary figures from the city\u2019s Public Security Police issued on Monday, indicate Macau welcomed just over 1.22 million visitors between February 7 and February 14 inclusive.\r\n\r\nBetween February 7 and 13, the number of visitors from Greater China went up 4.7 percent from the 2015 holiday season, to one million arrivals, accounting for 94.4 percent of all arrivals, said the tourism office. The preliminary arrival figures quoted by the tourism office also include migrant workers and other people living in Macau under different visa arrangements.\r\n\r\nDuring the period there were nearly 800,000 visitors from mainland China. They were 73 percent of total arrivals, a 4.3 percent increase on the prior-year holiday. Visitor numbers from Taiwan rose 42.7 percent \u2013 to a record 24,000. The number from Hong Kong surpassed 190,000 with an increase of 2.6 percent. Visitor arrivals from international markets climbed 4.4 percent on the 2015 holiday period, to 60,000.\r\n\r\nThe operator of Macau International Airport said in a Monday press release that from February 8 to 14 the facility welcomed 160,000 passengers and handled 1,200 flight movements, representing growth of 23 percent and 6 percent respectively comparing to the prior-year holiday period.\r\n\r\nThe airport management said on February 13 the airport set an all-time record for daily passenger volume and flights, with 29,000 passengers processed and 204 flight movements.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe believe the larger tourism arrivals in Macau reflect favourably on Macau\u2019s focus to diversify its economy and develop itself into a destination market. It would also bode well for Macau gaming\u2019s paradigm shift that is increasingly driven by mass over the long run,\u201D said a note on Monday from brokerage Sanford C. Bernstein Ltd."},

	"text":"Utilisation of China\u2019s ultra-high-voltage (UHV) power transmission lines, designed to send excess electricity in remote interior regions to coastal centres battling worsening air pollution, has been lower than expected, according to analysts.\r\nSCMP Today: Intl Edition\r\nGet updates direct to your inbox\r\nE-mail *\r\nBy registering you agree to our T&Cs & Privacy Policy\r\n\r\nThe high-capacity UHV lines, more efficient and economic for long-distance transmission, are expected to cost state-owned State Grid Corporation more than 600 billion yuan (HK$711 billion) to build until 2020. But they\u2019ve also turned out to be no panacea for the nation\u2019s renewable power distribution bottlenecks.\r\n\r\n\u201CUtilisation of the UHV lines remains below expectations [due to] many factors \u2026 such as the performance of connected generation plants, constraints in the local power grids, [hydro power resource] conditions, as well as [power] demand conditions,\u201D Hu Xinmin, senior manager at Hong Kong-based industry consultancy The Lantau Group, said in a report.\r\n\r\n\u201CAs such, efficiently coordinated planning of grid and generation [capacity], under changing economic and regulatory conditions, will become even more important to ensure better utilisation of fuel, environmental and capital resources.\u201D\r\n\r\nCiting figures from State Grid, which has a power distribution monopoly in all but five southern regions in mainland China, he noted its first three UHV lines, commissioned between 2009 and 2012, had reached capacity utilisation of only 21 per cent to 56 per cent in 2014.\r\n\r\nChina is the first nation with the stated ambition of using UHV power lines as the \u201Ccore\u201D to inter-connect its regional power grid networks into a \u201Cstrong and smart\u201D national network, a strategy championed by State Grid around a decade ago.\r\nTo meet this original 2020 target, China would need to more than double its UHV development effort, which seems unlikely given the challenges\r\nHu Xinmin, The Lantau Group\r\n\r\nIn 2009, State Grid officials said it had \u201Cfully grasped the core technology\u201D of UHV power distribution, and planned to plough some 600 billion yuan into UHV lines by 2020.\r\n\r\nIn 2013, it outlined an eight-year plan to build 37 UHV lines totalling 89,000km by 2020, of which 11 would be built by the end of last year, and 19 by the end of next year.\r\n\r\nBy the end of last year, only eight lines with a total length of 11,900km were in operation.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo meet this original 2020 target, China would need to more than double its UHV development effort, which seems unlikely given the challenges,\u201D Hu wrote.\r\n\r\nHe said the slower-than-planned progress was due to a likely divergence in views between the National Energy Administration (NEA), the sector\u2019s regulator, and State Grid on the desired degree of inter-connection between regional grid networks, slowing power demand growth, planning delays and system integration challenges.\r\n\r\nJudging from the pattern of project approvals, he said the NEA seemed to prefer strengthening regional grids at this stage rather than inter-connecting regional grids as originally planned by State Grid, due to reliability risks.\r\n\r\n\u201CState Grid\u2019s vision to synchronise regional power grids is almost certainly not being taken seriously,\u201D he said, adding the United States also had \u201Cvirtually no prospect\u201D of fully integrating regional grids since costs outweighed benefits.\r\n\r\nDennis Ip, head of utilities and renewables research at Daiwa Capital Markets, said in a report that rapid deceleration in China\u2019s power demand growth and rising power generation overcapacity had also played a role in delaying the progress of UHV lines expansion, with local governments in consumption centres cutting power imports to protect local power plant operators suffering from falling utilisation.\r\n\r\nWind and solar farm operators\u2019 hopes that the construction of UHV lines would bring significant relief to the distribution bottlenecks they face in sending power out from wind- and solar energy-rich but sparsely-populated northern regions have also been dashed.\r\n\r\nIp said on average only 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the transmission capacity of UHV lines could be used to send wind and solar power, since it was intermittent in nature and required the mixing of conventional electricity, like coal-fired power, whose output was more stable throughout the day.\r\n\r\nHe noted even the UHV line linking Hami in Xinjiang and Zhengzhou in Henan province, which sourced as much as 40 per cent of input from renewable energy, had suffered from low utilisation since it was commissioned in early 2014, and it was under repair and maintenance half of last year due to damage caused by huge load fluctuations."},

Most markets in the region will re-open from Wednesday, with Chinese markets returning next week.\r\n\r\nThe volatility affecting global markets last month appears set to continue amid concern about Chinese economic growth, falling oil prices and speculation that the US federal reserve could change course with interest rates.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe combination of concerns that the United States could be heading toward a recession and the global stock sell-off is curbing risk appetite and is sending investors to the safe-haven yen,\u201D Takuya Takahashi, senior strategist at Daiwa Securities, told Kyodo News.\r\nFacebook\r\nTwitter\r\nPinterest\r\nIs the global economy about to crash? \u2013 video explainer\r\n\r\nAfter hovering around the 117-yen line on Monday, the Japanese currency briefly rose to the upper 114 zone to its strongest level against the dollar since November 2014. Investors regard the yen as a \u201Csave haven\u201D currency when global markets are hit by the kind of turmoil witnessed in recent weeks.\r\n\r\nThe yen is expected to make further gains \u2013 a trend that eats into the repatriated profits of Japanese auto and other exporters. Three-month dollar\/yen implied volatility \u2013 which indicates how much currency movement is expected in the months ahead - reached 12.137% its highest since September 2013.\r\n\r\nResponding to the yen\u2019s rise, Japan\u2019s finance minister, Taro Aso, told reporters: \u201CIt is clear that recent moves in the market have been rough. We will continue to carefully monitor developments in the currency market.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe dollar was last at 115.26 yen, down 0.6%, after dropping as low as 114.75.\r\n\r\nKaneo Ogino, director at foreign exchange research firm Global-info Co in Tokyo, described it as a \u201Cpanic situation\u201D.\r\n\r\nOgino added that investors would be closely watching the US federal reserve chair Janet Yellen\u2019s testimony to the house financial services committee on Wednesday for any clues that the central bank might be prepared to slow future rate hikes as market turbulence and global economic uncertainty continue.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe focus is now on Yellen\u2019s comments tomorrow, and how she\u2019ll respond to these latest market conditions,\u201D Ogino said.\r\n\r\nThe flight to safety also saw Japanese government bond yields dive below zero for the first time, extending a downtrend sparked by the Bank of Japan\u2019s surprise move last month to adopt negative interest rates on some commercial lenders\u2019 deposits.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe Nikkei has been well and truly savaged today,\u201D said Chris Weston, chief markets strategist at IG in Melbourne. \u201CIt is clear that strong buying in the Japanese government bond market is not going to drive the (yen) weaker in times of extreme volatility, so negative rates have little bearing on markets.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Bank of Japan\u2019s rates decision has prompted fears that after years of monetary easing, central banks have few avenues left to explore to encourage investment and boost growth.\r\n\r\nTalk of an impending recession in the US, however, is creating speculation among investors that the federal reserve will put on hold its attempts to normalise rates.\r\n\r\n\u201CThe \u2018fear factor\u2019 in markets has morphed from being about an emerging market hard-landing and collapsing oil prices to being about the extent of the slowdown in the developed world and the ability of central banks to reflate asset values yet again,\u201D said analysts at Citi in a note.\r\n\r\nThe pessimism isn\u2019t universal, however. In a report released at the weekend, Goldman Sachs said there was just a 25% risk that recession would hit industrialised economies in the next year, rising to 34% over the next two years.\r\n\r\nBoth forecasts fall below the average risk seen in the past 35 years, despite the turmoil in financial markets. In the US, the probability of a recession in the next four quarters is just 18%, and 24 in the eurozone, according to the US bank\u2019s economics team."}]},

This is the most difficult period that we are experiencing since the financial crisis,\" Xu said, referring to the index that tracks rates for ships carrying dry bulk commodities.\r\n\r\n\"Our two firms had similar operations, we did not have many advantages in the various sectors we operate in and could not count on economies of scale...The merger is crucial to the development of both companies,\" he added.\r\n\r\nWith 830 vessels including container ships, dry bulk vessels and tankers, COSCOCS will own almost twice as many ships as rivals AP Moller Maersk and Mitsui O.S.K Lines combined, according to data from ship valuation firm VesselsValue which does not take into account chartered-in vessels.\r\n\r\nThe merger of the two groups, whose listed units include China COSCO and China Shipping Container Lines involved asset swaps worth 60 billion yuan ($9.21 billion), he said.\r\n\r\nCOSCOCS is the latest firm to emerge out of a government campaign to clean-up and raise the global competitiveness of China's state-owned firms through creating what it calls \"national champions\". To date, Beijing has created railway giant CRRC Corp and nuclear producer State Power Investment Corporation.\r\n\r\nBesides fulfilling the government's reform goals, Xu also said that the merger also supports one of the world's largest shipping fleets supports China's \"One Belt, One Road\" policy to increase trade and open new markets for its firms.\r\n\r\n\"Meeting the demands of China's One Belt, One Road policy will not be possible without a strong shipping fleet,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe new group\u2019s headquarters will be in Shanghai. \r\n\r\nThe restructuring of COSCO and China Shipping can be called the most complicated deal ever for the capital market. More than 70 complicated transactions in assets were carried out. \r\n\r\nOn the evening of February 1, 2016, three listed companies including China COSCO, China Shipping Container Lines and COSCO Pacific jointly announced that the various bills on major assets restructuring of COSCO and China Shipping were adopted with a high approval rating of 99 percent.

Empire\u2019s service territories, business lines and corporate culture are highly complementary to Liberty Utilities and we will continue Empire\u2019s history of prudently investing in its systems, communities and employees,\u201D Robertson added.\r\n\r\nAs noted by Brad Beecher, Empire\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, \u201COver the years, Empire has focused its energies on its core values of providing safe, reliable and economical service to its customers, a fair return to its shareholders, and a safe and positive work experience for its employees. We are not only pleased that our shareholders will be fairly compensated for their investment in Empire, but also that we\u2019ve found a partner who shares our same values, is dedicated to continuing to serve our customers and communities at a high level, and is committed to maintaining the strong working relationships we have developed with our regulatory agencies.\u201D\r\n\r\nTransaction Highlights\r\n\r\nSignificant Growth in Regulated Utility Operations\r\n\r\nUpon closing, the Transaction will add C$4.1 billion of utility assets and 218,000 customers to Liberty Utilities\u2019 current portfolio of utility operations resulting in a total asset base of APUC of C$8.9 billion, an 87% increase. As a result of the Transaction, APUC\u2019s business mix will shift towards regulated utility operations, with EBITDA from regulated utility operations increasing from 51% to 72% on a pro forma basis.3\r\n\r\nConsistent with APUC\u2019s Financial Goals\r\n\r\nThe Transaction is expected to be immediately accretive at close to APUC\u2019s EPS and FFOPS and generate average annual accretion to EPS and FFOPS of approximately 7% to 9% and 12% to 14%, respectively, for the three year period following closing. The Transaction will provide additional support to APUC\u2019s annual dividend growth target of 10%.\r\n\r\nThe financing plan to complete the Transaction is designed to maintain APUC\u2019s current credit profile and strong investment grade credit ratings.\r\n\r\nAPUC and Empire Have Complementary Operations\r\n\r\nEmpire is a regulated investment grade utility with approximately 90% of its on system revenue from Missouri and Arkansas, regulatory jurisdictions that Liberty Utilities has operated in for many years. The Transaction further diversifies Liberty Utilities\u2019 electric, gas, and water utility operations and provides an entry into two new markets in Oklahoma and Kansas.\r\n\r\nEmpire\u2019s management team will strengthen Liberty Utilities\u2019 leadership team, particularly in the mid-states region. Both companies have compatible cultures with a focus on safety, reliability, customer service and efficiency.\r\n\r\nCommitment to Empire\u2019s Communities, Customers and Employees\r\n\r\nFollowing the close of the Transaction, Empire will continue to be regulated by the State Commissions, the FCC and the FERC and will continue to operate under the Empire name. The transaction will not affect Empire\u2019s customers or their rates paid for service. APUC intends to maintain the existing Empire operating and management structure within its Liberty Utilities umbrella. No changes to management or employee staffing at Empire are expected as a result of the Transaction, and Empire will maintain its existing headquarters location in Joplin, Missouri. Following closing of the Transaction, APUC expects to consolidate existing Liberty Utilities operations in the region under the Empire senior leadership. In addition, Liberty Utilities has pledged that Empire will maintain its historic levels of community involvement and charitable contributions and support in its existing service territories.\r\n\r\nAcquisition Financing\r\n\r\nAPUC has obtained a US$1.6 (C$2.2) billion fully committed bridge debt financing from CIBC Capital Markets, J.P. Morgan, Scotiabank, and Wells Fargo to finance the Transaction. Permanent financing is expected to be obtained by placements of common equity, preferred equity, convertible debentures and long term debt, along with the assumption of existing Empire indebtedness.\r\n\r\nThe timing of remaining financing activities will be influenced by the regulatory approvals process and is subject to prevailing market conditions.\r\n\r\nAdvisors\r\n\r\nWells Fargo Securities, LLC acted as lead Merger Advisor and JPMorgan acted as lead Financial and Strategic Advisor to APUC. Husch Blackwell LLP served as transaction legal counsel and Choate Hall & Stewart LLP served as finance legal counsel to APUC.\r\n\r\nMoelis & Company LLC acted as exclusive financial advisor to Empire.

Each forward-looking statement in this press release speaks only as of the date of the particular statement. For additional information with respect to certain of the risks or factors, reference should be made to the management\u2019s discussion and analysis section of APUC\u2019s most recent annual report, quarterly report and Annual Information Form and to Empire\u2019s filings with the SEC. Except as required by law, APUC and Empire disclaim any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\r\n\r\nInformation Concerning Non-GAAP Measures\r\n\r\nThe terms EBITDA and \u201CFunds From Operations Per Share\u201D are used in this press release. The terms EBITDA and \u201CFunds From Operations Per Share\u201D are not recognized measures under GAAP. There is no standardized measure of EBITDA and \u201CFunds From Operations Per Share\u201D, consequently APUC\u2019s and Empire\u2019s method of calculating these measures may differ from methods used by other companies and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies. A calculation and analysis of EBITDA and \u201CFunds From Operations Per Share\u201D can be found below.\r\n\r\nEBITDA\r\n\r\nEBITDA is a non-GAAP measure used by many investors to compare companies on the basis of ability to generate cash from operations. APUC uses EBITDA to assess the operating performance of APUC without the effects of (as applicable): depreciation and amortization expense, income tax expense or recoveries, acquisition costs, litigation expenses, interest expense, gain or loss on derivative financial instruments, write down of intangibles and property, plant and equipment, earnings attributable to non-controlling interests and gain or loss on foreign exchange, earnings or loss from discontinued operations and other typically non-recurring items. APUC adjusts for these factors as they may be non-cash, unusual in nature and are not factors used by management for evaluating the operating performance of the company. APUC believes that presentation of this measure will enhance an investor\u2019s understanding of APUC\u2019s operating performance. EBITDA is not intended to be representative of cash provided by operating activities or results of operations determined in accordance with GAAP.\r\n\r\nFunds from Operations Per Share\r\n\r\nFunds from operations is a non-GAAP measure used by investors to compare cash flows from operating activities without the effects of certain volatile items that generally have no current economic impact or items such as acquisition expenses and are viewed as not directly related to a company\u2019s operating performance. APUC uses adjusted funds from operations to assess its performance without the effects of (as applicable) changes in working capital balances, acquisition expenses, litigation expenses, cash provided or used in discontinued operations and other typically non-recurring items affecting cash from operations as these are not reflective of the long-term performance of the underlying businesses of APUC. Funds from operations per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding. APUC believes that analysis and presentation of funds from operations on this basis will enhance an investor\u2019s understanding of the operating performance of its businesses. It is not intended to be representative of cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with GAAP. "},

	"text":"A Chinese mining company will begin copper production at a controversial site in central Myanmar in May, a month after the new government led by the opposition party comes to power, a corporate spokesman said Friday.\r\n\r\nThe large mine project operated by China\u2019s Wanbao Mining Copper Ltd. Company and Union of Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd. (UMEHL), a Myanmar army-owned conglomerate, in the town of Letpadaung in Sagaing region has come under fire by local farmers who have long protested the company\u2019s land takeovers in the area.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe will start copper production in May, a month after the new National League for Democracy (NLD)-led government takes power,\u201D Dong Yunfei, Wanbao\u2019s spokesman, told RFA\u2019s Myanmar Service.\r\n\r\nHe added that Wanbao expected to benefit from good relations with the NLD government because party leader Aung San Suu Kyi would make policy decisions based on the rule of law and national reconciliation.\r\n\r\n\u201CSo we believe the country will be more developed,\u201D he said.\r\n\r\nThe mine is one of several Chinese operated megaprojects under way in the Southeast Asian nation that have come under fire from locals because of environmental damage and expropriated land.\r\n\r\nSuch protests prompted the ruling Union Solidarity and Development Party (USDAP) led by President Thein Sein in 2011 to suspend construction of the Myitsone Dam and hydroelectric power development project by the China Power Investment Corporation [CPI] in Kachin state for five years.\r\n\r\nDong Yunfei, however, said he wasn\u2019t concerned that a similar fate might befall the Letpadaung project.\r\n\r\n\u201CHuge projects like this one are planned, agreed to and signed by both sides under the full extent of the law and legalities,\u201D he said. \u201CSo, everything will proceed according to the law.\u201D\r\n\r\nInquiry commission\r\n\r\nAung San Suu Kyi, whose NLD party won general elections last November by a landslide, had led a parliamentary inquiry commission on the Letpadaung project, calling for more transparency in the project\u2019s land appropriation process and for police riot control training in the wake of a violent raid on protesters at the mine site in 2012.\r\n\r\nIn 2014, she accused the government of ignoring the commission\u2019s recommendations to improve conditions at the mine, which she said sparked clashes that December between police and farmers trying to prevent Wanbao employees from fencing off land for the project. The incident left one farmer dead and dozens injured. The USDP, however, rejected her claims.\r\n\r\nIn response to continued protests, Wanbao canvassed local villages in 2014 and 2015 and met with farmers one-on-one to try to resolve the issue, Dong Yunfei said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe are still trying to meet the demands of local people,\u201D he said, adding that Wanbao wanted to compensate villagers who had not accepted money the company previously offered them for land it had taken for the mining site.\r\n\r\n\u201COur doors are open all the time for compensation,\u201D Dong Yunfei said. \u201CWe suggest that those who haven\u2019t taken the compensation come forward.\u201D\r\n\r\nWanbao offered money to the family of Khin Win, the farmer who was shot and killed during the December 2014 protest, to compensate them for their loss, but they never showed up to collect it, he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe heard there was division of opinions among the family members,\u201D he said. \u201CWe don\u2019t know the latest situation now.\u201D\r\n\r\nmyanmar-letpadaung-sagaing-region-400.jpg\r\nThe map shows Letpadaung in northwestern Myanmar's Sagaing region. Credit: RFA RFA\r\nNo crop compensation\r\n\r\nWanbao, however, has no plan to compensate villagers annually for money they would have otherwise made from crops, because the company leased the land from the government, not the farmers, Dong Yunfei said.\r\n\r\nWanbao and UMEHL previously said they would pay farmers the highest market rate for crops at the site, but locals rejected the offer and demanded the return of their land.\r\n\r\nPolice stopped 200 farmers last month from protesting the company\u2019s decision not to compensate them for crops that had been destroyed or displaced.\r\n\r\nThwei Thwei Win, a Letpadaung farmer and activist, told RFA that Wanbao has not conducted any further negotiations with locals whose land the company took in the run-up to the start of copper production in May.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere have been no negotiations or discussions between residents and the company,\u201D she said. \u201CThe company had not informed locals about anything. Because of this, I see no way to resolve the issues between the farmers and the company.\u201D\r\n\r\nUnder the new government, however, Letpadaung villagers expect the NLD to help resolve the matter with Wanbao, she said.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe expect the new government will do something for our farmers\u2019 problems,\u201D she said. \u201CWe also expect to push to the government as well as the company until we finally see results.\u201D\r\n\r\nNo dealings yet\r\n\r\nBut NLD party spokesman Nyan Win said the new government hasn\u2019t had any dealings with Wanbao yet regarding the Letpadaung copper mine.\r\n\r\n\u201CI think their production plan is according to its own schedule,\u201D he told RFA. \u201CWe have no way making any deals [with Wanbao] because government power has not yet been transferred to our party.\u201D\r\n\r\nAung San Suu Kyi must examine whether or not Wanbao has implemented the recommendations of the parliamentary inquiry commission, he said.\r\n\r\n\u201CLetpadaung can resume production only after complete implementation of the recommendations of the inquiry commission,\u201D he said. \u201CWe don\u2019t know whether the implementation has been done, but we have the commission\u2019s report with the full list of recommendations.\u201D\r\n\r\nAs for the Myitsone dam, Myan Win said the NLD hasn\u2019t seen documents pertaining to the agreements between China and Myanmar regarding the project.\r\n\r\n\u201CThere is no transparency, and we haven\u2019t seen the contracts,\u201D he said, adding that the NLD-led government would follow domestic and international laws when making decisions about Chinese megaprojects in Myanmar.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the NLD will examine such documents, before deciding the dam\u2019s fate, Nyan Win said.\r\n\r\nReported by Kyaw Kyaw Aung, Tin Aung Khine and Thinn Thiri for RFA\u2019s Myanmar Service.

	"text":"After decades of false starts, solar power in America is finally poised for its breakthrough moment. The price of solar panels has dropped by more than 80 percent since President Obama took office, and the industry is beginning to compete with coal and natural gas on economics alone.\r\n\r\nRelated\r\nInside the Koch Brothers' Toxic Empire\r\n\r\nTogether, Charles and David Koch control one of the world's largest fortunes, which they are using to buy up our political system. But what they don't want you to know is how they made all that money\r\n\r\nBut the birth of Big Solar poses a grave threat to those who profit from burning fossil fuels. And investor-owned utilities, together with Koch-brothers-funded front groups like American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), are mounting a fierce, rear-guard resistance at the state level \u2013 pushing rate hikes and punishing fees for homeowners who turn to solar power. Their efforts have darkened green-energy prospects in could-be solar superpowers like Arizona and Nevada. But nowhere has the solar industry been more eclipsed than in Florida, where the utilities' powers of obstruction are unrivaled.\r\n\r\nThe Sunshine State has the best solarity east of the Mississippi, and the third-best rooftop solar potential in America. Yet measured by solar production, it ranks just 16th in the nation. It's dwarfed by solar giants like California. Florida even lags behind Northern states like New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York. \"It defies logic,\" says former Florida Gov. Charlie Crist. \"It's absolutely absurd.\"\r\n\r\nThe solar industry in Florida has been boxed out by investor-owned utilities (IOUs) that reap massive profits from natural gas and coal. These IOUs wield outsize political power in the state capital of Tallahassee, and flex it to protect their absolute monopoly on electricity sales. \"We live in the Stone Age in regard to renewable power,\" says state Rep. Dwight Dudley, the ranking Democrat on the energy subcommittee in the Florida House. \"The power companies hold sway here, and the consumers are at their mercy.\"\r\n\r\nThe full political might of Florida's IOUs was on display in December, when a deceptive campaign, funded by the state's electric utilities, crushed a citizen-led effort to open Florida to solar competition through the 2016 ballot. \"When your opponents have no ethical foundation, have unlimited resources and are willing to say and do anything to defeat you,\" says Stephen Smith, director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, which led the pro-solar effort, \"it's a tough hurdle to overcome.\"\r\n\r\nIt should come as no surprise that the utilities have fought so hard. The rise of cheap, distributed solar power poses a disruptive \u2013 and perhaps existential \u2013 threat to the traditional electric utility business.\r\n\r\nMonopoly electric utilities used to make sense. Dirty power, generated at a distance from population centers, was carried over a set of transmission lines to homes and businesses. Consumers got reliable power from a single provider. IOUs were guaranteed a profit \u2013 both for building power plants and transmission lines as well as for the electricity itself.\r\n\r\nBut in recent years, the nation's IOUs have been abusing their monopoly powers to profit from massive infrastructure projects. Utilities more than doubled their capital expenditures last decade; costs were paid for by electric customers, whose power bills have soared nearly 40 percent. For investors, the formula is simple: More infrastructure equals more profit.\r\n\r\nThe rise of distributed solar power poses a triple threat to these monopoly gains. First: When homeowners install their own solar panels, it means the utilities build fewer power plants, and investors miss out on a chance to profit. Second: Solar homes buy less electricity from the grid; utilities lose out on recurring profits from power sales. Third: Under \"net metering\" laws, most utilities have to pay rooftop solar producers for the excess power they feed onto the grid. In short, rooftop solar transforms a utility's traditional consumers into business rivals.\r\n\r\nThe surge of solar competition has caught the nation's dirty-power generators flat-footed: The utility trade group Edison Electric Institute (EEI) warns that rooftop solar could do to the utility industry what digital photography did to Kodak, bringing potentially \"irreparable damages to revenues and growth prospects.\"\r\n\r\nFew industries are worse equipped to deal with disruption than power utilities. Their profits depend on infrastructure investments that pay off over a generation or more. \"Utilities are structured to be in stasis,\" says Zach Lyman, partner at Reluminati, an energy consultancy in Washington, D.C. \"When you get fully disrupted, you've got to find a new model. But utilities are not designed to move to new models; they never were. So they play an obstructionist role.\"\r\n\r\nThe Sunshine State is a gold mine for its monopoly IOUs. Air conditioning drives the second-highest electrical consumption in the nation; the average Florida household spends $1,900 a year on power \u2013 40 percent more than the national average. Fossil fuel dominates electricity generation: Florida is 61 percent dependent on natural gas, followed by coal at 23 percent. Solar makes up less than one percent of the state's energy mix.\r\n\r\nFlorida; Solar Power; Opposition\r\nSolar activists in Florida face stiff opposition from utilities. \"The power companies hold sway here,\" one state lawmaker says, \"and the consumers are at their mercy.\" Chris Zuppa\/AP\r\n\r\nKey policies that have spurred a rooftop solar revolution elsewhere in America are absent or actually illegal in Florida. Unlike the majority of states, even Texas, Florida has no mandate to generate any portion of its electricity from renewable power. Worse, the state's restrictive monopoly utility law forbids anyone but the power companies from buying and selling electricity. Landlords cannot sell power from solar panels to tenants. Popular solar leasing programs like those offered by SolarCity and Sunrun are outlawed. Rooftop solar is limited to those who can afford the upfront expense; as a result, fewer than 9,000 Florida homes have panels installed.\r\n\r\nFlorida's anti-solar policies are zealously defended in Tallahassee. \"It's no secret we play an active role in public policy,\" says Mark Bubriski, spokesman for Florida Power & Light (FPL), the largest IOU in the state. FPL is the monopoly power provider for 4.8 million customers, whose electric bills generated $1.65 billion in profit for the company last year.\r\n\r\nThe utilities are top political donors in Florida. Since 2004, the state's four largest IOUs contributed at least $18 million to state politicians and political committees \u2013 a preponderance to Republicans, who now control state government. In addition, since 2007, the companies spent at least $12 million on lobbying, employing an average of one lobbyist for every two legislators in Tallahassee. \"They've got a pretty good harness on the whole deal up there,\" says Crist.\r\n\r\nThe capital city of Florida is more \"Southern Gothic\" than \"South Beach.\" Tucked away on Florida's panhandle, Tallahassee is a slow-walking city of whitewashed churches, wide verandas and dusky oaks, draped with Spanish moss. Nothing from its outward appearance would suggest this city of 190,000 is the seat of power for a state whose economy rivals Indonesia's.\r\n\r\nA seven-hour drive from Miami, four hours from Tampa and another three from Jacksonville, Tallahassee sits at a far remove from the watchful eyes of voters in Florida's biggest cities. The business of the state transacts in a tiny three-block district in the shadow of Florida's modern Capitol building, a white 22-story tower flanked by a pair of low-slung domes that look \u2013 how to put this \u2013 happy to see you.\r\n\r\nRelated\r\nObama Takes on Climate Change: The Rolling Stone Interview\r\n\r\n\"I don't want to get paralyzed by the magnitude of this thing. I'm a big believer that imagination can solve problems,\" says the president\r\n\r\nFlorida is served by a part-time legislature. Lawmakers make less than $30,000 a year and are subject to strict term limits. The paltry pay and constant turnover combine to fill the capital with baby-faced lawmakers who run point on policy matters in which they have little expertise. Even Republicans say the model enhances the power of special interests. \"Out in eight years?\" says one GOP state representative, referring to term limits. \"You're giving more power to lobbyists.\" \u2029Florida's pay-to-play energy politics outrage honest conservatives. Nancy Argenziano is a 61-year-old firecracker of a politician with short dark hair and piercing eyes. She served as a GOP state legislator for more than 10 years. Until 2010, she chaired the state's Public Service Commission (PSC) \u2013 the arm of the legislature that regulates Florida's power companies. Argenziano is unsparing in her assessment: \"The legislature is owned by the utilities. To me, it's extremely corrupt. The legislature takes millions from utilities, who make billions from [the decisions of] the PSC. They get what they pay for.\"\r\n\r\nThe utilities' political reach even extends to the governor's mansion, a stately brick building graced by a classical portico that \u2013 only in Florida \u2013 sits a 10th of a mile from a pawnshop where you can turn your gun into cash. Republican Gov. Rick Scott's narrow 2014 re-election was financed by more than $1.1 million in contributions from the IOUs.\r\n\r\nThe governor did not respond to interview requests. But Scott has earned ridicule for allegedly banning state officials from using the terms \"global warming\" and \"climate change.\" Shortly after his re-election, he filled an open slot on the PSC with Jimmy Patronis, then-Florida state chair of ALEC, which fights renewable-energy mandates and climate regulations.\r\n\r\nRick Scott; Solar Energy; Florida\r\nGov. Scott has taken more than $1 million from the utilities. C.M. Guerrero\/Getty\r\n\r\nBowing to the businesses the PSC is supposed to regulate, the commission recently scaled down Florida's energy-efficiency mandates and terminated a modest rebate program for the private purchase of solar panels. \"I don't want to give handmaidens a bad name,\" says state Rep. Dudley, \"but they're servants of the utility industry.\"\r\n\r\nEven as it rolls back green initiatives, the PSC has rubber-stamped fossil-fuel boondoggles. In an unprecedented move, it approved FPL's proposal to frack for natural gas \u2013 in Oklahoma. FPL convinced the PSC that the project, financed by the electric bills of its customers, would save money. But after a rocky first year, the project has already cost ratepayers nearly $6 million. \"It's a total rip-off,\" says Dudley.\r\n\r\nDudley has the fire of a reformer. A tall man who favors pinstripe suits, he has repeatedly introduced legislation to curb the abuses of the PSC and open Florida to solar competition. But he says he can't even get a hearing in the Republican-dominated capital. \"From a legislative perspective,\" he says, \"we've really been stonewalled.\"\r\n\r\nSeeking to crack open Florida's energy market at the ballot box, the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) mounted a $2 million campaign to qualify a \"Solar Choice\" amendment for the 2016 election. The constitutional amendment would have ended Florida's rare lock on electricity sales; only Kentucky, Oklahoma and North Carolina have similar prohibitions. It would have freed consumers to install leased solar panels on their rooftops at no upfront expense. Retailers could have installed solar arrays and sold power to tenants in the same shopping complex.\r\n\r\nSACE is directed by Stephen Smith, a tall Tennessean with water-blue eyes who dresses like Tom Wolfe on casual Friday. To advocate for solar choice, SACE knit together an implausible \"green tea\" coalition \u2013 comprising Tea Party activists and environmentalists like the Sierra Club, in alliance with Florida's retail and restaurant federations, as well as religious groups like the Christian Coalition of America.\r\n\r\nThe campaign led with voices from the far right. Coalition member Debbie Dooley helped found the Tea Party and today directs Conservatives for Energy Freedom. The 57-year-old grandmother may run her shoestring outfit out of the back of a 2010 Hyundai Sonata, but she has an impressive track record, spearheading a two-year fight that overturned anti-solar restrictions in Georgia in 2015 \u2013 creating thousands of clean-energy jobs.\r\n\r\nAt a campaign luncheon in a Presbyterian church in downtown Tallahassee in November, Dooley is wearing a lime-green suit jacket and matching jeweled earrings, and lamenting that she had to leave her Chihuahuas \u2013 Chi Chi and Chico \u2013 back home in Buford, Georgia. With a delicious drawl, Dooley insists that her view is the right view: \"Conservatives champion free-market choice, not government monopolies that stifle competition.\"\r\n\r\nDooley embodies a political trend that many environmentalists don't appreciate, says Jigar Shah, the former CEO of SunEdison who now runs his own investment firm, Generate Capital. A passion for solar has taken root among people who may not \"give two shits\" about the environment, Shah says. \"The reason Debbie Dooley is involved is that the Tea Party people who support Ted Cruz believe very strongly that the electric utility company is every bit 'the man' as the government is.\"\r\n\r\nSolar Power; Florida\r\nThe view from the Magnolia Clubhouse in the community of Trilogy, where homes are using solar energy with panels on rooftops. Octavio Jones\/Zuma\r\n\r\nConfronting a popular threat to their monopoly power, the utilities fought back \u2013 with a vengeance. But rather than campaign directly against the Solar Choice amendment \u2013 which polled at nearly 70 percent \u2013 the IOUs mounted a competing ballot initiative called the \"Smart Solar\" amendment. Despite the name, their amendment doesn't advance the cause of solar power. Quite the reverse: \"It locks existing statute into the constitution,\" says a skeptical Republican Florida lawmaker.\r\n\r\n\"They've twisted the words around so that it keeps the monopolies in place,\" former Vice President Al Gore explained at a Climate Reality Project conference in Miami, blasting the utility initiative as the \"dumb\" solar amendment. Even Jack Abramoff, the infamous influence peddler, traveled to Tallahassee to denounce the utility amendment as \"right out of the lobbyist playbook.\" Abramoff, who served four years in federal prison, is now seeking atonement by crusading against special-interest corruption. The Smart Solar campaign, he says, \"reminds me very much of what we used to do in the old days ... Now it's a fight between two amendments \u2013 so they can obfuscate what's going on.\"\r\n\r\nThe Smart Solar amendment is financed, nakedly, by the state's top investor-owned utilities, which ponied up $4 million through December, more than half the campaign's total haul. \"We are proud of who supports our campaign,\" says spokeswoman Sarah Bascom. Other supporters include conservative pressure groups funded by fossil-fuel interests. 60 Plus \u2013 a seniors group that has received $15 million from the Koch donor network \u2013 donated more than $1 million. The National Black Chamber of Commerce (NBCC), a tiny organization with an oversize name, added $100,000. The NBCC is funded by major polluters, including Exxon; its latest convention was sponsored by Koch Industries and Gulf Power. NBCC founder Harry Alford, unabashed, touts the \"cozy, productive relationship we have with the fossil-fuel corporations.\" The Koch grassroots political group, Americans for Prosperity, does not appear on Smart Solar's donor rolls, but did issue a call to arms for its Florida activists to fight solar choice.\r\n\r\nRelated\r\nWhy We Have to Kiss Off Big Carbon Now\r\n\r\nAs climate-change activists pressure public institutions to dump their fossil-fuel investments, it's becoming increasingly clear that the right thing to do is also the smart thing to do\r\n\r\nThe Smart Solar campaign played dirty. In a seemingly transparent effort to confuse petition-signers, the utility-backed measure aped the \"choice\" language of the rival pro-solar campaign with its formal ballot title. Smart Solar called itself Rights of Electricity Consumers Regarding Solar Energy Choice. \"It's pure deception,\" an exasperated Smith tells Rolling Stone. \"Many, many people have been misled into signing their petition \u2013 it's fraud!\" Bascom insisted there was no intention to mislead. \"It would defy all logic,\" she tells Rolling Stone. \"Why would we confuse ours with one that does not have public support?\"\r\n\r\nIn the end, the utilities crushed the Solar Choice campaign by spending it into submission. Qualifying an amendment for the ballot in Florida is onerous and expensive under the best of circumstances. It requires nearly 700,000 signatures, and any serious campaign hires paid gatherers.\r\n\r\nBy mounting a competing measure, the utilities sparked a financial arms race \u2013 with the utility-backed measure typically paying gatherers twice as much per signature. \"When we were paying a dollar on the street, they were paying $2,\" says Smith. \"When we were paying $2, they went to $4.\" Soon, the IOUs had forced solar proponents into a burn rate of $350,000 a week. It was unsustainable.\r\n\r\nSolar Choice threw in the towel in January. The campaign is now regrouping, aiming to qualify instead for 2018, when more than 400,000 signatures it has gathered would still be valid. Smart Solar is pressing ahead for the November ballot. If it passes, the utilities will be entitled, under the constitution, to hit rooftop solar customers with high fees simply to maintain their connection to the grid.\r\n\r\nBut Florida Power & Light isn't waiting until November to take a brazen victory lap. In January, it submitted a proposal to the PSC, seeking to hike its electric rates by nearly 24 percent over the next three years and asking the commission to reward FPL investors with a higher guaranteed rate of return. If approved, FPL's electric consumers would typically pay an extra $13 a month.\r\n\r\n\"FPL spent millions fighting to deny consumers solar choice,\"says Dooley, furious. \"Now they have their hand out, asking for a subsidy.\"\r\n\r\nDooley; Florida; Solar Power\r\nTea Party co-founder Dooley has fought for solar and says it represents true conservative values. David Goldman\/AP\r\n\r\nFlorida is an extreme example of utility-funded efforts to thwart the rise of solar power at the state level. But it's not unique. Major utilities across the nation are seeking to undermine competition from rooftop solar by hiking its cost. \"The utilities have realized they're completely up a creek without a paddle,\" says Shah, who sees the utilities lashing out at solar not from a position of strength but of desperation. \"They can certainly fight it. But they're going to lose.\"\r\n\r\nThe utilities are working from a playbook developed by ALEC \u2013 the Koch-funded group that promotes \"model\" bills, often adopted virtually wholesale by Republican legislatures \u2013 and the Edison Electric Institute, the utility trade group.\r\n\r\nThe political argument advanced by ALEC and EEI is that rooftop solar generators are freeloaders on the traditional grid infrastructure: They rely on conventional power when the sun isn't shining, but because they sell power back to the grid, they don't pay much on net. An ALEC report on rooftop solar implausibly holds up utilities as champions of the economically vulnerable, arguing that net metering creates a \"regressive tax, subsidizing the rich by picking the pockets of the poor.\"\r\n\r\nSuch arguments ignore the clear value rooftop solar producers create for other customers on the grid \u2013 including producing power at times of peak demand and adding resiliency against outages. Most obvious: Rooftop solar producers pay for their own equipment and volunteer their real estate \u2013 avoiding expenditures by utilities that would otherwise get passed along to ratepayers. A 2013 study for Arizona's largest utility found the benefits of rooftop solar \"exceed the costs by more than 50 percent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter some initial legislative setbacks, the utilities and their allies are now working in the shadows \u2013 seeking to persuade utility regulators to put the brakes on solar by, in essence, taxing rooftop producers.\r\n\r\nArizona \u2013 a state that spends up to 85 percent of the year in sunshine, and stands second in the nation with a solar capacity of 1,800 megawatts \u2013 was ground zero for this approach. Last winter, the Salt River Project (SRP), the utility that serves Phoenix, hiked fees for rooftop solar customers and tacked on a murky \"demand charge.\" The effect was to increase bills for customers with solar panels by a whopping $50 per month.\r\n\r\nSRP touts itself as a \"community-based nonprofit.\" But in an internal e-mail, an SRP director condemned solar advocates as \"the enemy.\" (SRP would disavow the comment as a joke.) The utility's price hike puts into action policies long promoted by ALEC, which endorses \"a fixed grid charge\" for solar customers. SRP's new fees have throttled the local rooftop market: Solar lease applications are down as much as 96 percent, according to SolarCity. In a scathing open letter, CEO Lyndon Rive blasted SRP for working to \"entrench\" its monopoly by \"shuttering the solar industry in one of the sunniest places in the United States.\" SolarCity is now suing SRP, alleging violation of federal antitrust laws.\r\n\r\nCalifornia; Solar Panels; Power; Home; Rooftop\r\nA SolarCity Corp. employee carries a solar panel being installed on the roof of a home in the Eagle Rock neighborhood of Los Angeles. Patrick T. Fallon\/Getty\r\n\r\nEmboldened, for-profit utilities went for the jugular in America's solar giant, California. Other states measure solar output in megawatts; California produces more than 10 gigawatts \u2013 nearly half the nation's total. Rooftop solar has exploded thanks to bountiful sunshine and a generous net-metering\r\nlaw. Today, nearly five percent of California's power is generated by rooftop solar. But this success also triggered a state review of the payments to rooftop producers \u2013 opening the door for utility monkey-wrenching.\r\n\r\nThe state's biggest utilities lobbied the California Public Utility Commission (PUC) last year to hit rooftop producers with Arizona-style fees. Southern California Edison sought increases averaging $800 a year for its rooftop solar customers. But in the Golden State, solar producers are now a formidable political constituency all their own. In November, advocates of preserving the state's net-metering program delivered 130,000 signatures to the PUC in wheelbarrows.\r\n\r\nIn December, the head of the PUC declared the utilities had failed to provide \"a real basis\" or \"evidence\" to justify the massive rate hikes on solar customers. In January, the PUC adopted only minor changes; the ruling was hailed as a huge win by the solar industry.\r\n\r\nNevada has some of the greatest solar potential in America; Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid touts his home state as the \"Saudi Arabia of solar energy.\" But where California rejected the Arizona model, Nevada is taking it to the next level.\r\n\r\nIn late December, the state's PUC commissioners \u2013 all appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval \u2013 announced huge price hikes for rooftop solar customers. The changes will add nearly $40 a month to solar homeowner electric bills \u2013 wiping out the $15 a month in typical solar savings. The Nevada charges were put into effect despite the PUC's own admission, reported by Forbes, that rooftop solar customers \"do not impose any significant additional costs\" on other ratepayers. In an unprecedented move, the new charges were also made retroactive, punishing the state's 17,000 existing solar customers.\r\n\r\nUntil recently, Nevada was one of the fastest-growing solar markets, but providers are now fleeing the state: SolarCity, Sunrun and Vivint are winding down their operations. \"This is the first state to close up a solar market, eliminating thousands of jobs as we speak,\" says Bryan Miller, vice president of public policy for Sunrun. His company is suing the state, promising to expose cronyism between Sandoval and the state's biggest utility, Nevada Energy. Noting that the governor's top two political advisers are lobbyists for the utility, Miller insists, \"This is a story of political corruption.\" (\"Of course, we reject this latest spurious and reckless charge against Nevada's state government,\" Sandoval spokeswoman Mari St. Martin tells Rolling Stone.)\r\n\r\nRoiling the economy of an early-voting state in an election year, Nevada's solar politics have already become a growing issue in the presidential campaign. At a Las Vegas rally just before New Year's, Bernie Sanders called the PUC decision \"just about the dumbest thing I have ever heard.\"\r\n\r\nEven as the solar industry faces unprecedented regulatory obstruction at the state level, its future on the federal stage has rarely been brighter. In mid-December, Congress stunned activists, solar-industry executives and investors by cutting a deal to renew billions in federal support for solar power that had been slated to expire at the end of 2016 \u2013 avoiding a \"solar cliff\" that could have staggered the industry.\r\n\r\nSigned into law with the $1.8 trillion year-end budget, the solar accord extends a tax credit that offsets up to 30 percent of solar project costs \u2013 even as those costs continue to plummet. The impact is projected to be massive: 20 gigawatts of new solar power added over the next five years, nearly doubling the nation's output.\r\n\r\nBut this freakish fit of solar bipartisanship is fragile. In no uncertain terms, the American solar industry will be on the 2016 ballot. Last year, the Obama Environmental Protection Agency finally unveiled its mechanism to curb the power sector's carbon emissions. By 2030, the Clean Power Plan would reduce national electricity sector emissions by one-third. Under the plan, the administration projects renewables like solar will rise to 28 percent of U.S. power generation.\r\n\r\nObama; Solar Power\r\nUnder Obama, solar power has skyrocketed. Ethan Miller\/Getty\r\n\r\nClean Power will be implemented \u2013 or not \u2013 depending on the will of Obama's successor. Republicans have made clear their ambition to dismantle the work of the current EPA. Donald Trump calls global warming \"bullshit\" and a \"hoax.\" Ted Cruz calls the Clean Power plan a \"radical attempt to destabilize the nation's energy system.\"\r\n\r\nHillary Clinton, by contrast, has promised to build on Obama's plan, vowing to treat it as the \"floor, not the ceiling.\" Clinton has an ambitious plan for solar energy. She calls for the installation of half a billion solar panels in her first term \u2013 a move that she says would drive a sevenfold increase in U.S. solar-power production. For his part, Sanders has not detailed a specific solar policy, but has promised \"massive\" investments in clean power to drive an 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2050.\r\n\r\nOver time, Dooley believes, solar power will win out, not only on the economics, but because there's nothing partisan about it. In fact, she says, solar power is one of the few things on which Democrats, Republicans and independents can find common ground. \"Who doesn't want to be able to have solar panels on their rooftops?\" Dooley asks. \"Who doesn't want to become an entrepreneur \u2013 selling energy generated on their private property to their neighbors, and make a profit off of it?\"\r\n\r\nOther than the monopoly utilities and the Koch brothers, who have their backs, she asks, \"Who doesn't want energy freedom?\""}]},

The company employs approximately 373,000 people serving clients in more than 120 countries. In December 2015, Accenture\u2019s clients included 94 of the Fortune Global 100 and more than 80 percent of the Fortune Global 500. The prestige of Accenture and its leadership in the top corporate consulting space is likely to significantly boost blockchain-based fintech.\r\n\r\n\u201CBlockchain and distributed-ledger technologies enable the financial industry to move away from reconciliation-based processes that are expensive and inefficient,\u201D said David Treat, managing director and global head of Accenture\u2019s capital markets blockchain practice. \u201COur new practice, which builds on the strong growth of our global capital markets business, can help clients move from concept to production in the shortest possible time, improving efficiency and unlocking new revenue streams.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Accenture press release notes that, according to the firm Aite Group, investment in new blockchain-enabled financial technologies will more than quintuple over the next four years, from an estimated $75 million in 2015 to $400 million by 2019. In June 2015 Santander InnoVentures, the $100 million fintech venture capital fund of Santander Group, Oliver Wyman and Anthemis Group, published a paper titled The Fintech 2.0 Paper: rebooting financial services. The paper noted that international payments remain slow and expensive, and significant savings can be made by banks and end-users bypassing existing international payment networks, and suggested that distributed ledger technology could reduce banks\u2019 infrastructure costs attributable to cross-border payments, securities trading and regulatory compliance by between $15 billion and $20 billion per annum by 2022.\r\n\r\nAccenture has also formed an alliance with Digital Asset Holdings to help institutions assess and implement block chain-related solutions. The two companies will collaborate on innovative solutions for banks, brokerages and infrastructure providers that Accenture will implement as a preferred systems integrator. A Digital Asset Holdings press release notes that, besides Accenture, the company is forming partnerships with Broadridge and PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).\r\n\r\n\u201CAccenture is a renowned leader in large-scale systems transformation and the development of complex technology infrastructure,\u201D said Blythe Masters, CEO of Digital Asset Holdings. \u201CWorking together, we can dramatically accelerate the adoption of blockchain technology globally. Our products and software combined with Accenture\u2019s expertise at integrating new technologies with existing systems will help institutions reduce settlement latency, risk, operating costs and capital requirements.\u201D\r\n\r\nAccenture and Digital Asset Holdings are key members of the Hyperledger Project, a high profile initiative spearheaded by the Linux Foundation, which wants to develop develop a new open source blockchain separated from the Bitcoin blockchain. \u201CThe development of blockchain technology has the potential to redefine the operations and economics of the financial services industry,\u201D said Richard Lumb, chief executive of Accenture\u2019s Financial Services.\r\n\r\nAccenture and Digital Asset Holdings support closed, \u201Cpermissioned\u201D blockchains that would offer the advantages of digital currencies \u2013 fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared distributed ledger \u2013 without the troublesome openness of the Bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously. Instead of anonymous miners, only banks and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate transactions in permissioned blockchains.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo be used by financial institutions, including capital markets firms and insurers, blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by Bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security, privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus,\u201D said two Accenture executives in July. \u201CWith private chains, you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors,\u201D Digital Asset Holdings CEO Blythe Masters said in September. \u201CThat appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the bitcoin blockchain.\u201D\r\n\r\nOther experts, including legendary cryptographer Nick Szabo, strongly argued that financial operators should, instead, embrace the crowd-sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like Bitcoin.\r\n\r\nBitcoin Magazine reached out to Treat to find out more about Accenture\u2019s position in the permissionless vs. permissioned blockchain debate.\r\n\r\n\"Permissionless blockchain solutions were driven by the desire to transfer value \u2013 whether cryptocurrency or other digital assets \u2013 without the need for a trusted third-party,\u201D Treat told Bitcoin Magazine. \u201CThat has tremendous power, but also distinct limits in terms of use cases and scalability.  Permissioned blockchain solutions tip the dynamic towards groups of known actors who can message, transfer, and validate transactions in a number of ways with the necessary controls (e.g. AML\/KYC). They are less constrained by latency and scalability challenges, which opens a multitude of opportunities for financial institutions to remove inefficiencies.\"\r\n\r\n\u201CPermissioned-based solutions enable faster and more scalable consensus mechanisms because the nodes are controlled by known chosen actors,\u201D added Treat. \u201CIn a permissioned environment, the ledger can be engineered along a much wider array of consensus mechanisms, including multi-signature, Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerant, Proof of Stake, Zero Knowledge Proof, etc.\u201D"},

	"text":"SAN FRANCISCO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE:ACN) today announced the launch of the Accenture Cyber Intelligence Platform, a new addition to Accenture\u2019s Managed Security offerings. The Accenture Cyber Intelligence Platform marries advances in chip processor technology with a proprietary combination of artificial intelligence, machine learning and streaming analytics to help organizations identify never before seen, network-born cyber threats in near real-time. The platform examines network flows and DNS data streamed from existing network components to learn, determine and report ranked suspicious behaviors attributable to malicious cyber attack techniques.\r\n\r\n    \u201CToday\u2019s best network protection devices alone are not enough to challenge the new reality of cybersecurity\u201D\r\n    Tweet this\r\n\r\nThe Accenture Cyber Intelligence Platform is the first to harness Accenture\u2019s quick-to-deploy, scalable technologies and new high performance big data-processing power, giving organizations an unprecedented level of flexibility. Underpinned by Accenture\u2019s as-a-Service capabilities and the Accenture Cloud Platform, it can typically be implemented within one week. Once enabled, the Accenture Cyber Intelligence Platform automatically begins to learn \u201Cwhat\u2019s normal\u201D and then continuously improves. Organizations can easily scale the service as needed, while also benefiting from the industry experience of Accenture\u2019s broader managed security service professionals who not only run the platform but also are available to analyze, interpret and respond to security alerts.\r\n\r\nThe platform features a highly customized version of Open Network Insight \u2013 an open-source solution that delivers visibility into operational and security threats facing dynamic data centers \u2013 and Cloudera\u2019s enterprise data hub. In benchmark testing, the platform proved to deliver up to a 10-fold increase in processing speed versus market alternatives.\r\n\r\n\u201CToday\u2019s best network protection devices alone are not enough to challenge the new reality of cybersecurity,\u201D said Vikram Desai, managing director, Accenture Analytics \u2013 Security Lead. \u201CAttackers continue to evolve by leveraging data technology, and clients have urged us, as the leading provider of data science solutions, to help them fight back. Our new Accenture Cyber Intelligence Platform gives them back the upper hand.\u201D\r\n\r\nAccording to IDC analyst Christina Richmond, program director of security services, Accenture\u2019s new platform introduces an important advance in which companies can now leverage network telemetry data that they already own to rapidly identify cyber criminals based upon their behavior versus traditional filters or patterns.\r\n\r\n\u201CTo maintain business resiliency in today's constant state of security emergency, businesses need the highest level of offensive threat visibility and detection and defensive incident investigation and remediation,\u201D said Richmond. \u201CIt is vastly preferable to share or leverage threat data from multiple industry players in order to gain broader insight into heretofore-unknown cyber security threats. The collection and correlation of this data is what IDC calls \u2018iterative intelligence.\u2019 With this new offering, Accenture has created a platform into which a company leverages its network flow and DNS data to draw strong conclusions which can be shared with a broader ecosystem of experts who can work to help companies strengthen their defense capabilities and empower their businesses to move from proactive to predictive threat detection. This is the very nature of iterative intelligence.\u201D\r\n\r\nThe Accenture Cyber Intelligence Platform expands Accenture\u2019s end-to-end portfolio of cyber defense services which include strategy, transformation, managed security services, automated threat intelligence, monitoring, advanced analytics and real-world adversary simulations, as well as incident response and remediation. It represents another step forward in Accenture\u2019s platform-driven, intelligence-based strategy to accelerate its client\u2019s journeys to an as-a-Service business model.\r\n\r\nAbout Accenture\r\n\r\nAccenture is a leading global professional services company, providing a broad range of services and solutions in strategy, consulting, digital, technology and operations. Combining unmatched experience and specialized skills across more than 40 industries and all business functions \u2013 underpinned by the world\u2019s largest delivery network \u2013 Accenture works at the intersection of business and technology to help clients improve their performance and create sustainable value for their stakeholders.

Neither PwC, Deloitte, EY, nor Bain and Co. reveal their diversity numbers in this level of detail. What\u2019s more, IBM, another major Accenture competitor, is one of the few tech giants that still refuses to release its stats.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe already spend a lot of time and money and focus [on increasing diversity], and yet we\u2019re not making the progress that we want to, so we feel like we need to be disruptive,\u201D says Julie Sweet, CEO of Accenture, North America, on the company\u2019s decision to publish the data.\r\n\r\nThe release reveals that women account for about 36% of the company\u2019s total U.S. workforce.\r\n\r\nAccenture, which is No. 98 on Fortune\u2018s 100 Best Companies to Work For list, is roughly half white and a third Asian. Black employees make up 7.4% of the company\u2019s workforce, while Hispanic or Latino employees hold 6.3% of jobs.\r\n\r\nWomen lose some ground at the company\u2019s upper level, accounting for 31% of executives.\r\n\r\nThe executive ranks are also notably less diverse, with black and Hispanic employees accounting for just 4.4% and 3.7% of top jobs, respectively.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Accenture revealed that it currently employs 1,450 people who self-identify as persons with disabilities and 1,000 veterans. (The company has pledged to hire an additional 5,000 vets or spouses of vets by 2020.)\r\n\r\nAccenture has committed to releasing updated diversity numbers each year. Although it did not lay out specific goals for 2016, Sweet is clear that she expects the company to make gains over last year\u2019s stats: \u201CWe think we can do more.\u201D\r\n\r\nMaking the numbers public will hold the company accountable for showing improvement, she says. What\u2019s more, Sweet hopes that this new level of transparency will allow Accenture to have more explicit, productive discussions about race and gender internally.\r\n\r\nTo help speed the pace of change, the company also announced that it is starting a new referral program that will reward employees who refer women, black, Hispanic, and veteran candidates who end up getting hired. This comes on the heels of a slate of new parent-friendly policies announced last year, including 16 paid weeks of maternity leave and an option for new parents to work locally for one year after the birth of their child.\r\n\r\n\u201CWhen I took my new role as chief executive of North America, I had this realization that with 48,000 and a $14 billion business I had a real opportunity to make change \u2014 and I feel a deep sense of responsibility,\u201D Sweet says. \u201CI personally feel I will have failed if I do not make progress toward making us the most inclusive and diverse workforce in the U.S.\u201D\r\n"}]},

The investigation included the use of two excavators to recover more than 80 bags full of paper accounts that had been buried six meters underground by the Ezubo's executives.\r\n\r\nCalls for supervision\r\n\r\nNow, Ezubo's burned investors are pessimistic about recovering their money.\r\n\r\n\"In China, it's extremely difficult to claim money back under such scenarios,\" Jiang said. \"The prosecution process is not transparent and procedures are very confusing.\"\r\n\r\nLike many critics on Chinese social media, Jiang said she was deeply disappointed with the lack of official supervision companies like Ezubo recieved, as well as the government's failure to compensate fraud victims.\r\nA sign sits on a wall outside the offices of Julius Baer Group Ltd. in Geneva, Switzerland.\r\nChina the elephant in the room: Julius Baer CEO\r\n\r\nAs large as Ezubo's case, it represents just a tiny part of China's shadow banking industry. Thanks to strong demand from small and medium-sized companies for loans, as well as a hardy risk appetite among private investors looking for better returns than are available in a nascent fund management sector, online P2P platforms have boomed over the past two years.\r\n\r\nThe P2P market grew by 288 percent on-year be worth $982.3 billion RMB ($151 billion) in 2015, according Xinhua, which cited data published by Wangdaizhijia.com, a Chinese financial services web portal.\r\n\r\nAnd so common are collapses in the sector that almost 900 platforms were reported to be \"problematic\" in 2015, a threefold increase on 2014, according to the Xinhua report.\r\n\r\nOne Chinese P2P investor, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNBC, \"There were as many as seven micro-lending companies in my neighborhood, selling financial products with extremely high returns of 30 to 40 percent.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would seriously question the credibility of these businesses, but there was no supervision from the government,\" the 53-year-old investor said.\r\n\r\nHe lost almost all his savings - 3 million RMB ($450,000) - after investing into a P2P company named Sichuan Fortune Union, which now faces similar fraud charges as Ezubo.\r\nBusiness man near window\r\nOp-Ed: China's disappearing billionaire effect\r\n\r\n\"There are very few wealth management channels in China and our stock market is extremely risky,\" said the investor. \"For ordinary Chinese people who don't have fully financial knowledge but want to invest, such products are very attractive.\"\r\n\r\nIn December the China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC) laid out draft controls on online P2P companies, including a requirement to register with local financial regulators and disclose information on borrowers and other risks.\r\n\r\nAnd Xinhua reported last month that Chinese authorities were working with bank regulators to set up a warning system for financial risks.\r\n\r\nBut this is little comfort for investor Jiang.\r\n\r\n\"Maybe after a few years, if I'm lucky, I can get part of my investment back,\" she said.\r\n\r\nCORRECTION\r\n\r\nThis report has been updated to reflect that China's wealth management industry is worth approximately $2.6 trillion."},

In 1991 ZF TRW introduced the industry\u2019s first \u2018ball in ramp\u2019 rear caliper with integrated park brake. Due to its efficient design it has driven the conversion to full disc brake (front and rear caliper) primarily on C-segment vehicles and above leading to enhanced safety. This technology is still dominating world production on rear calipers. \r\n\r\nIntroducing the first electric park brake with the motor on caliper design concept in 2001 was an important first step toward the future of systems like brake by wire and the integration opportunities needed to support advanced safety systems. ZF TRW remains the world leader in this technology with more than 65 million produced.\u201D\r\n\r\nFuel efficiency has been another key driver in the development of disc braking systems \u2013 from lightweight materials where many calipers are now made of aluminum, in pursuit of \u2018zero drag\u2019 systems that produce the minimum of friction between caliper and rotor during non-braking service.\r\n\r\n\u201CZF TRW has been a pioneer in brake systems for several decades and continues to innovate across all aspects of the technology to provide best-in-class solutions for light vehicles globally.

Under moderate or aggressive acceleration, the tendency isn't as noticeable.\r\n\r\nBut if you were to try to soothe baby to sleep by driving slowly around the block, for example, there would be a pronounced jerk that would result in one fussy baby and one angry car shopper who just dropped $50,000 on an otherwise great all-wheel-drive alternative to the minivan.\r\n\r\nThe odd sensations may be the driver needing to adjust expectations to new technology. A visit to Piloteers.org, one of the leading Honda Pilot consumer message boards, shows fewer complaints about the transmission in a December thread than in a July thread about the same trim line.\r\n\r\nBrian Weinberg, director of retail operations at a Chicago-area Honda dealership, admitted the new technology takes getting used to.\r\n\r\n\"I drove one and I noticed the difference, but I've never driven a nine-speed before,\" he said.\r\n\r\nOf the 10 complaints filed on www.safercar.gov, the recall arm of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, none are for Honda's new nine-speed transmission.\r\n\r\n\"At this point, there hasn't been a service bulletin,\" Davis Adams, Honda product spokesperson, said of the voluntary notices automakers issue to dealers to fix or address a mechanical quirk. Technical service bulletins, or TSBs, are not mandated by NHTSA and are not recalls. \"If this is a major concern and critical mass to confirm it, then Honda will be quick to remedy it.\"\r\n\r\nThe Pilot transmission, tuned differently, is also in the 2016 Acura MDX, where it has drawn criticism from consumers.\r\n\r\n\"Just returned from dealership \u2026 because of the jerkiness in shifting, harsh downshifting and all-around horrible transmission behavior,\" posted gemesq in an April 2015 post on the MDX forum, MDXers.org.\r\n\r\nNine-speed transmissions provide better fuel economy with more precise performance. The nine-speed transmission manufactured by ZF Friedrichshafen AG for Honda and Acura uses 16 percent less fuel than a 6-speed at constant speeds, although they take some getting used to.\r\n\r\nZF also designed the troublesome nine-speed transmission in the Jeep Cherokee when it launched for model year 2014, and for other vehicles made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles such as the Chrysler 200 sedan and Fiat 500X crossover. The hundreds of complaints on www.safercar.gov included remarks about lunging, rough shift changes and even disengagement.\r\n\r\nFCA CEO Serigo Marchionne admitted to Automotive News on Feb. 2, 2015, that FCA had to do \"an inordinate amount of intervention on that transmission.\"\r\n\r\nFCA ordered successive software updates or \"reflashes\" to fix the problem, at the consumer's request.\r\n\r\n\"FCA launched a brand new transmission on the wrong vehicle,\" said Larry Vellequette, who covers FCA for Automotive News. \"New transmission, new engine, with a disconnecting rear drive system \u2014 it's a hugely complex piece of machinery.\"\r\n\r\nReluctant to talk about the new Pilot's transmission since he hasn't driven it, Vellequette added that FCA used ZF's design, but that FCA built the transmission itself.\r\n\r\nHonda, on the other hand, let ZF build the nine-speed transmission in its vehicles, which include the Acura MDX.\r\n\r\nDifferent automakers using the same transmission does not make the same results.\r\n\r\n\"We didn't put the Pilot out as quickly as Chrysler did with the Jeep,\" Adams said. \"This is the most modern version of the software, so we have better expectations.\"\r\n\r\nSince nine-speed transmissions such as the one used by FCA and Honda are adaptive, they read the driver's inputs and driving conditions to recognize patterns and optimize shift points. That might explain why consumer message boards are more forgiving and dismissive of transmission complaints.\r\n\r\nThe teething period can gnaw at the nerves of consumers who have dropped nearly $50,000 on a new car.\r\n\r\nShould drivers have new expectations or should they learn to drive differently to avoid a lurching ride?\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't recommend an early one,\" Vellequette said of nine-speed transmissions. \"As with any new technology, it takes a while to get through the teething pains.\""},

Before suspending his campaign, Christie had hammered at Trump, saying a vote for the New York billionaire equated to a vote for Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.\r\n\r\nWhitman\u2019s statement is probably the strongest yet by a mainstream Republican against Christie and exposes a growing sense of alarm about Trump winning the nomination.

	"text":"As an investor in Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), I find it's important to keep up-to-date on the automaker's current events. That has become increasingly difficult in the hectic automotive industry, which serves up a seemingly unlimited amount of financial sales data, earnings reports, vehicle launches, and more.\r\n\r\nWhen considering Ford's global sales data, keeping track of its gains and losses in its three most critical markets is a good place to start. Here are the highlights from Ford's first month of 2016 in China, Europe, and of course, right here in America.\r\n\r\nFord soars in China\r\nDetroit's second-largest automaker recorded an excellent January in China. Ford sold a record 130,832 vehicles, a hefty 36% increase over the prior year's January.\r\n\r\nF\r\nChart by author. Data source: Ford China press releases.\r\n\r\nNote that the change in line color on the chart above indicates Ford switching from reporting wholesale sales to retail sales. While the retail numbers will be a slightly lower number than wholesale, it didn't slow Ford down much. The carmaker posted an excellent finish to 2015 and started 2016 on the right foot.\r\n\r\nDriving Ford's record January results in China were SUVs, with the Ecosport, Kuga (Escape), Edge, Explorer, and Everest notching more than 37,000 units sold, up 75% from the prior year's January. Ford's passenger cars still dominate total sales, though, and the Escort set a record with nearly 29,000 units sold in January -- a sixfold increase from the prior year's January.\r\n\r\nLight at the end of the tunnel\r\nChina wasn't the only place overseas where Ford managed to increase its sales. For years investors have waited patiently for Ford's operations in Europe to generate a profit, and for years their patience was met with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses. Finally, in 2015, Ford broke through and generated an annual profit in the region, with some help from changes in its pension accounting. Ford continues to increase its sales in the region, and an increase in SUVs and a fresh lineup of vehicles should sustain the company's success.\r\n\r\nIt was Ford's best January in Europe since 2012, with sales reaching 96,900 in its 20 traditional European markets. That was a 10% increase over the prior January result, and fueled a 20-basis-point market share gain to a total of 7.9%.\r\n\r\nSimilar to the situation in China, Ford's European SUV sales were key drivers of the gains, with the EcoSport and Kuga sales checking in at 50% and 19% higher, respectively. In fact, Ford expects the launch of the new Edge SUV to help drive SUV sales 30% higher in the region during 2016. If that prediction proves true, 2016 will be the first time Ford's annual SUV sales in Europe top 200,000.\r\n\r\nOne of Ford's core strategies was to continue investing in its European vehicle lineup, even at a time when it was struggling to narrow bottom-line losses. Ford is continuing to implement that strategy, with plans to launch seven new and refreshed vehicles in Europe this year. It's pretty simple: Newer car designs sell better, and generally carry higher transaction prices, so investors should remain optimistic that even better days are ahead for Ford in Europe.\r\n\r\nMixed bag of results\r\nThe only potential blemish on Ford's January sales numbers came at home in the U.S. market.\r\n\r\nIt has been difficult for investors to decide how to grade Ford's January sales in the U.S., the market that produces the vast majority of the company's revenue. Total sales dropped 2.6% to 173,723 units, worse than the industry's 0.4% drop overall, and a poor result compared to its Detroit counterparts, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, which notched a 6.9% gain, and General Motors, which gained 0.5%.\r\n\r\nHowever, Ford didn't do as poorly as Toyota or Volkswagen, which recorded sales declines of 4.7% and 6.9%, respectively, compared to January 2015.\r\n\r\nThe downside to Ford's sales decline was that it happened during a month when Ford's sales to fleets increased by 20%. That means that Ford's retail sales were much worse than its 2.6% decline in total sales suggests -- retail sales fell by 11% in January. That compares poorly to General Motors' 9% increase in retail sales during the same time period.\r\n\r\nOn the bright side, sales of SUVs and trucks continue to juice Ford's average transaction price, which was up a staggering $1,800 per vehicle in January -- nearly three times the industry's average gain for the month.\r\n\r\nThat brings us to our next set of mixed results. Ford's most popular and best-selling vehicle, the F-Series full-size truck, was selling on average for $2,500 more than it was last January -- and, even sweeter, sales incentives for it declined $500. Essentially, each truck driven off dealership lots was really profitable for Ford during January. On the downside, total sales for the F-Series declined by 5% to 51,540 units. While Ford considers any month when it sells more than 50,000 F-Series trucks a solid month, January was still a bit disappointing considering the last few years of results.\r\n\r\nF\r\nChart by author. Data source: Ford Motor Company press releases.\r\n\r\nAlso, while the decline in F-Series sales was a bummer, investors should take it with a grain of salt because December was the first month in a decade that Ford sold more than 80,000 F-Series trucks. It's very possible December's holiday deals pulled some demand forward from January, and if you average out the two months it's still a very strong result.\r\n\r\nUltimately, while the U.S. was a mixed bag of results, there's no reason to panic. Investors should be thrilled that Ford continues to increase its sales in Europe, and that China's purchase-tax incentive has been a huge success in fueling sales that had sputtered over the summer."},

	"text":"Ford Motor Co. plans to build a new assembly plant in the Mexican state of San Luis Potosi and significantly increase its production in that country, according to multiple reports.\r\n\r\nThe plant will represent a $1.5 billion investment and allow Ford to build 350,000 cars annually, reports say. Ford is expected to announce the plans in the first quarter.\r\n\r\nReuters first reported the news last month, citing unnamed Mexican government officials. The Wall Street Journal on Monday said the new plant, and expansion of an existing plant, would double Ford\u2019s production in Mexico.\r\n\r\n\u201CWe do not comment on speculation,\u201D Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in a statement.\r\n\r\nFord last year said it would stop building its Focus and C-Max cars at its Michigan Assembly Plant and move production elsewhere. UAW officials said at the time that at least the Focus would move to Mexico. Ford executives have said they\u2019re looking for a cheaper option to build lower-profit vehicles like the Focus and C-Max, and Mexico would represent such an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThe automaker said in April it would invest $2.5 billion for two new engine and transmission plants and an expansion of a diesel engine line that will create about 3,800 jobs.\r\n\r\nFord will spend $1.1 billion to build an engine facility within its Chihuahua Engine Plant, where it will produce a new gasoline-powered engine, creating 1,300 jobs. Ford will export the engines to the U.S., Canada, South America and the Asia Pacific region.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Ford will spend $1.2 billion to build a transmission plant within the premises of a facility used by transmission supplier and partner Getrag, which is based in the city of Irapuato in the state of Guanajuato. The project will create 2,000 jobs. The new transmission plant \u2014 Ford\u2019s first transmission facility in Mexico \u2014 will produce two all-new automatic transmissions for key products primarily in South America, Europe and Asia Pacific as well as other North American markets.\r\n\r\nThe automaker will spend $200 million and create 500 more jobs to expand its I-4 and diesel engines production in Chihuahua.\r\n\r\nThe investment has drawn the ire of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, who has consistently mentioned Ford in his speeches, prompting President and CEO Mark Fields to send him a letter explaining what they\u2019re doing there.\r\n\r\nFord has 11,300 employees in Mexico and builds the Ford Fiesta, Fusion and Lincoln MKZ there.\r\n\r\nExecutives have said they have no plans to build a new plant in the United States. Ford last opened a new U.S. plant \u2014 the Dearborn Truck Plant \u2014 in 2004.\r\n\r\nFord isn\u2019t the only automaker investing in Mexico. General Motors Co. last year announced a $5 billion investment there over six years and Toyota Motor Co. said it will invest $1 billion in a Mexican plant. BMW AG, Volkswagen AG and its Audi unit, Nissan Motor Co., Kia Motors and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also have built or announced new plants or plant expansions there."},

	"text":"What: Shares of Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F) dropped 14% in January. The Blue Oval's common stock opened the month at $13.87, and closed at $11.94 on Friday, Jan. 29.\r\nImages\r\n\r\nSo what: Ford was caught in a broader sell-off of auto stocks that also hit most of its key competitors' shares. Investors have expressed concern that new-vehicle sales in the U.S. may be peaking, just as China's once-roaring expansion seems to be stalling. There's also concern that established auto industry stalwarts may be at risk of \"disruption\" from Silicon Valley efforts to develop advanced alternatives to their products. \r\n\r\nIn recent months, Ford CEO Mark Fields has moved aggressively to address that latter concern, announcing major investments in electrified vehicles and driverless-car technology and a new initiative that could lead Ford into the ride-sharing business. But some analysts have been skeptical of Ford's efforts, suggesting that there's more talk than action.\r\n\r\nNow what: Ford is still generating fat profits from its mix of products in North America. Economic cycles are a fact of life in the auto business, and Ford is very well positioned to get through the next major downturn in the U.S. Meanwhile, it's still generating strong profits in Asia, and its operation in Europe has recently returned to profitability. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I think the threat of \"disruption\" is greatly overblown, at least in the near term. Silicon Valley darling Tesla Motors has yet to prove that it can generate a sustainable profit, and other potential rivals are at least several years way from building a single car -- assuming that they even try. \r\n\r\nAt current prices, Ford's dividend yield is hovering around 5% -- and it's likely to be able to sustain that dividend even if the market slumps. For long-term Ford investors, there's no big reason to sell now."},

	"text":"Car investors take note: There's big news on Wall Street this morning, as Swiss megabanker Credit Suisse takes out its big red pen and marks down shares of Ford Motor (NYSE:F) to underperform.\r\n\r\nThe news\r\nIn a terse note reported on StreetInsider.com this morning, investment bank Credit Suisse announced that it's cutting its rating on Ford stock from neutral to underperform. At the same time as it did so, however, Credit Suisse left its price target on the stock unchanged at $13 per share (nearly 12% higher than where the shares sit today). Why the disconnect, and why doesn't Credit Suisse think Ford is a buy, despite the shares being undervalued (and should you even care)?\r\n\r\nRead on to find out.\r\n\r\nFact 1: Ford can't make its guidance\r\nAs the Fool's own John Rosevear reported last month, Ford earned a \"record\" profit last year: $7.4 billion worth of greenbacks, and generated operating cash flow nearly as strong -- $7.3 billion. Performance in the all-important North American market looked particularly strong, with pre-tax profits leaping 26%.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, according to Credit Suisse, North America (or NA, as it says) is precisely the problem. With Americans buying light trucks hand over fist, Ford is predicting that 2016 profits will be \"equal to or greater\" than what we saw in 2015. But Credit Suisse warns that \"NA EBIT guidance is ... overly optimistic.\" Says the analyst: \"Pricing\/mix gains from new product launches in NA have been fully offset by material cost increases.\"\r\n\r\nTranslation: Ford is going to miss guidance.\r\n\r\nMedia\r\nFord's F-150 doesn't look so tough to Credit Suisse. Image source: Ford Motor.\r\n\r\nFact 2: It's not just North America\r\nContinuing to bang the gong of worry, Credit Suisse says that even outside of North America, \"global inventories ... have fallen meaningfully out of step with demand.\" So even if Ford sold nearly $150 billion in wares last year, Credit Suisse sees this not as an indicator of sales strength -- but of channel stuffing.\r\n\r\nWere we to stuff this banker's theory into a nutshell, crack it open and read what it says, the answer would go like this: Ford has pushed too much inventory into the market, and paid too-high costs to build it. Since demand isn't there, Ford will be forced to cut prices and boost incentives to move inventory this year -- and profits will fall.\r\n\r\nFact 3: General Motors is a better bargain right now\r\nIn a side note, Credit Suisse observed that it thinks General Motors (NYSE:GM) stock offers a better bargain than Ford today -- and they may be right.\r\n\r\nAt 4.7 times earnings, General Motors stock certainly looks cheaper than Ford and its 6.4 P\/E ratio. Similarly, GM's 5.3% dividend yield beats out the 5% divvy that Ford pays its investors. The $45 billion debt load that General Motors carries also looks easier to bear than the $112 billion in debt tottering atop Ford's balance sheet (albeit admittedly, much of this debt is loans to Ford car buyers).\r\n\r\nAnd one more thing...\r\nThe one piece missing out of this puzzle so far -- and the one that should perhaps interest investors who've seen Credit Suisse's downgrade most -- is this: How good of an analyst is Credit Suisse? Do these guys even known what they're talking about?\r\n\r\nThe answer is yes, unfortunately -- they do.\r\n\r\nAccording to our data here at Motley Fool CAPS, where we've been tracking Credit Suisse's performance as an analyst for nearly a decade, this Swiss investment banker is one of the best analysts of American stocks you'll find. Our stats confirm that over the past 10 years, Credit Suisse has outperformed 88% of the investors we track, and scored an average outperformance of the S&P 500 of better than 11 percentage points per pick.\r\n\r\nCredit Suisse has been especially good at picking automotive winners, where 62% of its recommendations have beat the market -- including two past sell recommendations on Ford.\r\n\r\nWhich as you might have noticed...is exactly what Credit Suisse is telling investors to do today."},

	"text":"CHICAGO \u2014 Ford said Thursday that it will launch four all-new sport-utility vehicles over the next four years in recognition of the growing global popularity of SUVs and crossovers.\r\n\r\n\"That\u2019s all new entries,\" Mark LaNeve, Ford's vice president of sales and marketing, said at the Chicago Auto Show. \"These are in segments of the SUV market where we currently do not compete.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, Ford is not saying when or where the new nameplates will be added, but it is emphasizing that the products are part of its global plan. As such, the new models could be added either to the automaker's mainstream Ford brand or to Lincoln.\r\n\r\nThe SUVs could be launched in North America, Europe, Asia or South America or in all of those regions.\r\n\r\nThe Dearborn, Mich.-based automaker also says there are no plans to eliminate any models as part of the plans.\r\n\r\nIn the U.S., consumers have been increasingly choosing to buy small and midsize crossovers, and the percentage of passenger cars is shrinking.\r\n\r\nLast year, LaNeve said Ford sold 740,000 Ford Escape, Explorer, Edge and Lincoln SUVs in the U.S., the most since the early 2000s.\r\n\r\n\"We can't keep them on dealer lots,\" LaNeve said.\r\n\r\nBoth Baby Boomers and Millennials increasingly prefer SUVs and crossovers because they offer more space than a car with the same footprint while also offering improved fuel economy over the SUVs of the past.\r\n\r\n\u201CSome SUVs now rival the fuel efficiency of V-6-powered midsize sedans from only a few years ago,\u201D LaNeve said.\r\n\r\nFord says its research shows that once Millennials begin thinking about starting a family, their interest in shopping for SUVs goes up significantly.\r\n\r\nWhile Millennials get driver's licenses later than prior generations, get married later and graduate from college later, \"they get there,\" LaNeve said.\r\n\r\nAnd when they do buy cars, they prefer SUVs."}]},

	"text":"Air France-KLM makes progress in 2015, but still has more to do. Labour productivity is at the heart\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM's 2015 was a big improvement on its strike-hit 2014, but it highlighted the progress that it still needs to make. It returned to net profit for the first time in six financial years and achieved its best operating margin since before the global financial crisis, although this was below its previous peak.\r\n\r\nIn the passenger network business, long haul profits soared and medium haul losses narrowed. LCC brand Transavia made another loss, but laid plans for its first base outside the Netherlands and France, to be established in Munich in Mar-2016. In the cargo segment, losses deteriorated in spite of capacity cuts, especially in its full freighter operation.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM generated a return on capital employed of 8.6% in 2015, a leap from 1.7% in 2014, but short of its 2017 target range of 9% to 11%. As the world airline industry already approaches levels of profitability higher than previous cyclical highs, Air France-KLM will need continued assistance from the global cycle. It will also need a new agreement on labour productivity, particularly with Air France flight crew.\r\nAir France-KLM's first annual net profit since Mar-2011\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM returned to profit in 2015, turning a net loss of EUR225 million in 2014 into a positive net result of EUR118 million. The operating result improved from a loss of EUR129 million in 2014 to a profit of EUR816 million in 2015. The 2014 result was adversely affected by pilot strikes, without which Air France-KLM would have reported an operating profit of EUR296 million.\r\n\r\nGroup ASKs (including LCC Transavia) grew by 2.5% and revenue increased by 4.6% in 2015, following a fall in revenue in 2014. The operating margin improved by 3.6ppts to 3.1%. Excluding the strike impact from the 2014 result, the margin improvement was 1.9ppts. Operating costs grew by only 0.7%, thanks mainly to a 6.7% drop in the fuel bill, while non fuel costs were up by 3.4%.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM financial highlights 2015\r\n\r\nEUR million except where stated\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2014\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2015\r\n\t\r\n\r\nChange\r\n\r\nRevenue\r\n\t\r\n\r\n24,912\r\n\t\r\n\r\n26,059\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4.6%\r\n\r\nEBITDAR\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2,462\r\n\t\r\n\r\n3,474\r\n\t\r\n\r\n41.1%\r\n\r\nEBITDA\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1,589\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2,447\r\n\t\r\n\r\n54.0%\r\n\r\nOperating result\r\n\t\r\n\r\n-129\r\n\t\r\n\r\n816\r\n\t\r\n\r\n945\r\n\r\nOperating profit %\r\n\t\r\n\r\n-0.5\r\n\t\r\n\r\n3.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n3.6\r\n\r\nNet profit\r\n\t\r\n\r\n-225\r\n\t\r\n\r\n118\r\n\t\r\n\r\n343\r\n\r\nNet debt\r\n\t\r\n\r\n5,407\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4,307\r\n\t\r\n\r\n-20.3%\r\n\r\nEquity\r\n\t\r\n\r\n-653\r\n\t\r\n\r\n273\r\n\t\r\n\r\n926\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM revenues (EUR million) 2014 and 2015\r\n\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\r\n2014\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2015\r\n\t\r\n\r\nChange\r\n\t\r\n\r\n% of 2015 revenue\r\n\r\nPassenger\r\n\t\r\n\r\n19,570\r\n\t\r\n\r\n20,541\r\n\t\r\n\r\n5.0%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n79%\r\n\r\nCargo\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2,681\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2,425\r\n\t\r\n\r\n-9.5%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n9%\r\n\r\nMaintenance\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1,251\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1,577\r\n\t\r\n\r\n26.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n6%\r\n\r\nTransavia\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1,056\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1,099\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4.1%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4%\r\n\r\nOther\r\n\t\r\n\r\n354\r\n\t\r\n\r\n417\r\n\t\r\n\r\n17.8%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2%\r\n\r\nTotal\r\n\t\r\n\r\n24,912\r\n\t\r\n\r\n26,059\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4.6%\r\n\t\r\n\r\n100%\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM\r\n\r\nThe net result in 2015 was the Air France-KLM Group's first net profit since the year to Mar-2011 (it then changed its financial year end to December in 2011) and only its second since the year to Mar-2008. In 2015, the group achieved only its third positive operating profit since the year to Mar-2008, although the 2015 operating margin of 3.1% was well short of that year's 5.9%, which was the highest in the group's existence.\r\n\r\nAlthough the 2015 returns to profit and to revenue growth are welcome, Air France-KLM's 3.1% operating margin does not compare well with CAPA's estimated average global airline operating margin of 7.2% in 2015 (a new high for the world's airline industry).\r\n\r\nSee related report: CAPA World Airline Profit Outlook 2016: margins at a new high of 8.2%. Fertile ground for new entry\r\n\r\nMoreover, although it is the first of the big three European legacy airline groups to report for 2015, it is likely to be the lowest margin among the three.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM revenue, net profit and operating profit (12 month period to date shown, EUR million) 2005-2015\r\n\r\n*proforma for year to Dec-2011. Note: accounting year end changed from March to December in 2011\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM\r\nBalance sheet management remains a priority\r\n\r\nIn spite of very weak profitability in recent years, Air France-KLM management has made a good job of managing liquidity and the balance sheet. At the end of 2015, its net debt fell by EUR1.1 billion, or 20% year-on-year, to EUR4.3 billion. With the exception of the strike-affected 2014 it has successfully lowered net debt every year, from its 2011 peak of EUR6.5 billion.\r\n\r\nYear-end cash was EUR3.8 billion, up 7% from 2014, which was equivalent to 53 days of revenue.\r\n\r\nThis reduction in net debt has been achieved by ensuring that annual capital investment is kept below the level of operating cash flow generated. In 2015, its capex was EUR1.6 billion, which was more than the EUR1.2 billion spent in 2014, but less than the EUR2.0 billion of operating cash flow. The group plans to increase capex to EUR1.6 billion-EUR2.0 billion in 2016 and EUR1.7 billion-EUR2.2 billion in 2017, which seems reasonable given the improving profit trend.\r\n\r\nIt is committed to a further \"significant reduction\" in net debt in 2016.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM development of net debt and cash 2005-2015\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM\r\nPassenger network segment drives the group result\r\n\r\nThe passenger network segment is the most important division in the Air France-KLM Group and its result is the main driver of the group result. In 2015, the passenger network division reported an operating result of EUR842 million, up from a loss of EUR86 million in 2014.\r\n\r\nNote that the name of this segment has been changed to 'passenger network' from the shorter 'passenger' in order to highlight that it includes only the network airlines Air France, KLM and Hop, and not the point-to-point airline Transavia.\r\n\r\nSince the formation of Air France-KLM in 2004, the group has only once made a positive annual operating result in a year when the passenger network business has made a loss (this was the year to Mar-2011). The group's profitability very much depends on that of its biggest segment.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM operating result for passenger network business segment and group total (12 month period to date shown, EUR million) 2005-2015\r\n\r\n*proforma. Note: accounting year end changed from March to December in 2011\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM\r\nLong haul profits exceed EUR1 billion; medium haul losses narrow\r\n\r\nAll three principal sub-networks within the passenger network segment improved their operating results in 2014. Although official audited sub-segment results are not reported, Air France-KLM has released its estimates of the operating result in each area for a couple of years now.\r\n\r\nAccording to these estimates, the long haul network made more than the whole business, achieving an operating result of EUR1,140 million in 2015, up from EUR740 million in 2014 (the 2014 figure is before the impact of the pilot strikes). Long haul ASKs were up 1.4%.\r\n\r\nThe medium haul networks continued to make losses, in spite of a 2.3% ASK cut, but managed to narrow the extent of red ink. Medium haul hub feed, which is closely tied to the long haul network, reduced its loss from EUR320 million in 2014 to EUR230 million in 2015, with ASKs almost unchanged (+0.4%).\r\n\r\nMedium haul point-to-point cut its loss from EUR120 million to EUR70 million, and its ASKs by 11.5%. Note that these 2014 operating result figures and the ASK growth rates exclude the strike impact.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM Passenger network segment: estimated operating result by 2013, 2014* and 2015\r\n\r\n*2014 figures exclude the impact of the pilots strike at Air France\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM estimates\r\nPassenger network segment ASKs up 2.3%; load factor stays ahead of legacy rivals\r\n\r\nThe passenger network's total ASKs increased by 2.3% in 2015. Without the effect of capacity lost to strikes in 2014, the underlying growth rate was just 0.7%. Air France-KLM has maintained tight capacity discipline for a number of years: its ASKs in 2015 were only 6% above their level in the year to Mar-2009, since when its average growth rate has been less than 1% pa.\r\n\r\nPassenger load factor increased once more, this time by 0.4ppts to 85.1%, keeping Air France-KLM ahead of both IAG (81.4%) and the Lufthansa Group (80.4%) on 2015 load factor.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM development of capacity (ASK million) and load factor (%) (12 month period to date shown) 2005-2015.\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM\r\nA \"high degree of volatility\" in unit revenue\r\n\r\nPassenger unit revenue increased by 2.8% in 2015 as reported, but it fell by 3.3% excluding the impact of currency movements and the previous year's strike from the figures. This 'like for like' RASK performance was down at a similar rate, -3.2%, in 4Q2015, but a significant cause of the weakness in the final quarter was the Paris terrorist attacks in Nov-2015.\r\n\r\nOn a conference call to discuss the 2015 results, Air France-KLM management told analysts that the underlying 4Q trend was a little better (-0.7%), and that the Paris impact was now receding.\r\n\r\nHowever, CFO Pierre-Francois Riolacci stressed that there was a \"high degree of volatility\" in unit revenue from month to month, and that the group was cautious about the outlook for this indicator.\r\n\r\nHe added that European market capacity growth would be around 7% on long haul and 6% on medium haul in summer 2016. There were no \"worrisome features\" in Jan-2016, but he expected Feb-2016 and Mar-2016 to be \"a bit weaker\", albeit without the \"bloodshed\" anticipated by \"a large low cost carrier\".\r\nCargo segment losses widen in spite of full freighter cuts\r\n\r\nAlthough the passenger network segment remains critical to the group's results, there is a wide range of profitability among the other segments.\r\n\r\nThe cargo segment continues to weigh on the group's profit and its operating loss worsened from EUR212 million in 2014 to EUR245 million in 2015. Air France-KLM blamed structural air cargo industry overcapacity. Cargo unit revenue fell by 5.6% as reported and by 12.8% excluding the favourable impact of currency movements, in spite of a 4.5% cut in cargo capacity (ATKs).\r\n\r\nThe group's strategic reduction in full freighter capacity is helping to limit losses in the cargo division. From 25 full freighters in 2008, it will have just nine in Jun-2016 (two 777-Fs at Paris CDG and three 747-ERFs at Amsterdam). Air France-KLM's full freighter capacity was down 23% in 2015.\r\n\r\nOperating losses from its full freighter operations narrowed from EUR97 million in 2014 to EUR42 million in 2015. It targets breakeven in this area in 2017.\r\nMaintenance segment has highest margin\r\n\r\nThe maintenance segment increased its operating profit from EUR174 million in 2014 to EUR214 million in 2015, with revenue up 18.3% to EUR4,012 million and a generated operating margin of 5.3.% versus 5.1% in 2014. It consistently maintains better margins than the group as whole.\r\n\r\nThe 'other' segment consists mainly of a catering unit, whose operating result more than doubled from EUR18 million to EUR37 million, with revenue up 8.7% to EUR947 million.\r\nTransavia: another loss in 2015, growth to accelerate in 2016\r\n\r\nLCC subsidiary Transavia, which comprises Transavia Netherlands and Transavia France, made another operating loss in 2015 (loss of EUR35 million versus EUR36 million loss in 2014) in spite of revenue growth of 4.1% and a 1.8% reduction in unit cost. Unit revenue fell by 1.6%.\r\n\r\nThe LCC increased its ASKs by 5.3% (focused on France, where capacity was up 24.6%) and its load factor gained 0.1ppts to 89.9%. Passenger numbers grew by 9.0% to 10.8 million. Air France-KLM said that its operating result was in line with its plan and that it remains on course to break even in 2017.\r\n\r\nTransavia will grow ASKs at the faster rate of 15% in 2016, with Transavia France growing by 20%. Air France CEO Fr\u00E9d\u00E9ric Gagey told analysts on the 2015 results conference call that the process of transferring slots from Air France to Transavia at Paris Orly, in order to serve leisure destinations, was now complete. The next phase was to grow its routes from provincial French cities, in addition to expanding the business into new European destinations.\r\n\r\nUnder the Netherlands arm of Transavia, the LCC brand will open a Munich base in Mar-2015. Management expects the Munich base to have a lower cost base than existing Transavia operations in France and the Netherlands, in spite of Munich's relatively high airport charges. This is  thanks to a new contract for flight crew (in particular, pilots), the outsourcing of ground operations and a lack of additional overhead. Munich is expected to be a relatively high-yield market. Further development of Transavia across Europe will require pilot agreement\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM's 2015 results presentation indicates that Transavia's fleet will grow to more than 65 aircraft in 2017, which is still smaller than the LCC fleets of its rival European legacy groups Lufthansa (with Eurowings) and IAG (with Vueling). Moreover, all three of these legacy-owned LCCs will be much smaller than the leading independent European LCCs.\r\n\r\nSee related report: Transavia: Munich to be first base outside home markets, but Air France-KLM's LCC still lacks scale\r\nTransavia integration a medium-term plan\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM CEO Alexandre de Juniac told analysts that a plan for Air France-KLM to integrate the management and ownership of the two halves of Transavia into a single holding company was \"probably mid term\". It would offer advantages in terms of efficiency and strategic focus and would be a simpler tool with which to participate in what Mr de Juniac called the \"LCC consolidation that will naturally happen in Europe\".\r\n\r\nThe merits of integrating Transavia under one structure are such that Air France-KLM would be better off making this a short-term plan. However, the development of the LCC remains a highly political subject, particularly in France, and the first priority for Transavia-related pilot negotiations is to agree its further expansion into European markets outside France and the Netherlands.\r\nKLM more profitable than Air France\r\n\r\nBoth major groups within the Air France-KLM group enjoyed an improvement in both revenue and operating profit in 2015.\r\n\r\nAir France increased revenue by 5.7% to EUR16,477 million and its operating result turned from a loss of EUR314 million in 2014 (this would have been a profit of EUR99 million without the pilot strike) to a profit of EUR462 million in 2015. KLM's revenue increased by 2.7% to EUR9,905 million and its operating result rose from EUR175 million in 2014 to EUR384 million in 2015.\r\n\r\nKLM's operating margin of 3.9% again beat that of its larger sister company Air France, whose margin was 2.8%. Nevertheless, 2015 was significant for Air France in that it was its first year of positive operating profit since the year to Mar-2008.\r\n\r\nSee related reports: Air France: Seven years of losses before Works Council clash reveals a cracked mirror\r\n\r\nKLM: a decade after Air France merger, the smaller, but more profitable partner also needs cost cuts\r\n\r\nAir France and KLM operating results and revenue (EUR million) 2013, 2014 and 2015\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA \u2013 Centre for Aviation, Air France-KLM\r\n2016: more capacity discipline, improved profit implied\r\n\r\nIn 2016 the Air France-KLM group plans ASK growth across all of its passenger airlines in the range of 1.0% to 1.4%, maintaining its tight capacity discipline (it has typically remained in a range of 1% to 2% in recent years). Air France will reduce capacity by 2%, KLM will grow by 3% and Transavia will accelerate to ASK growth of 15%.\r\n\r\nAlthough it maintains an average unit cost reduction target of 1.5% pa for 2015-2017, its target for 2016 is a reduction of only 1%, in spite of further fuel savings. It currently expects its fuel bill to be EUR4.5 billion in 2016, compared with EUR6.2 billion in 2015 and EUR6.6 billion in 2014.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM estimates that it retained only 30% of the benefit of lower fuel prices in 2015, the balance being offset by the weaker EUR versus USD and, more particularly, by unit revenue weakness. It expects that similar factors will again offset a significant part of its fuel savings in 2016.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it expects improved free cash flow, and this implies improved profit levels in 2016 (although it has not set a profit target).\r\n2017 and beyond: much depends on labour productivity\r\n\r\nFor 2017, the group's capacity plan will depend on the outcome of employee negotiations over labour productivity improvements, particularly at Air France. In Oct-2015 the French airline decided to cut its long haul ASKs by 10% from 2015 to 2017 (with the larger part of the cut deferred to 2017), after failing to reach a new agreement with flight crew unions.\r\n\r\nMr de Juniac told analysts that Air France could return to growth on long haul in 2017 if a satisfactory productivity agreement could be reached with labour representatives. The group CEO also said that Air France-KLM was watching the development of the long haul low cost model very closely and considering whether it was possible for the group to do something in this segment.\r\n\r\nHowever, he stressed that his \"first duty\" was to solve the \"problems in the mainline\" and a long haul low cost business would not achieve this.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that Air France-KLM's future growth is linked to labour productivity. In 2015, it achieved virtually stable overall capacity (total ATKs +0.1%) with 1.5% fewer employees. Labour productivity in ATK per employee increased by 1.5%. However, labour costs grew by 2.8% (inflated by non-cash pension related costs), so that employee costs per ATK were up by 2.8%. Fortunately, revenue per employee grew by 6.2%.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM labour productivity measures 2014 and 2015\r\n\r\n \r\n\t\r\n\r\n2014\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2015\r\n\t\r\n\r\nChange 2015 vs 2014\r\n\r\nTotal full time equivalent headcount\r\n\t\r\n\r\n97,847\r\n\t\r\n\r\n96,417\r\n\t\r\n\r\n-1.5%\r\n\r\nTotal labour cost EUR mill\r\n\t\r\n\r\n7,636\r\n\t\r\n\r\n7,852\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2.8%\r\n\r\nEmployee cost per employee (EUR)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n78,040\r\n\t\r\n\r\n81,438\r\n\t\r\n\r\n4.4%\r\n\r\nATK per employee\r\n\t\r\n\r\n458\r\n\t\r\n\r\n465\r\n\t\r\n\r\n1.5%\r\n\r\nEmployee costs per ATK (EUR)\r\n\t\r\n\r\n17.0\r\n\t\r\n\r\n17.5\r\n\t\r\n\r\n2.8%\r\n\r\nRevenue per employee\r\n\t\r\n\r\n254,602\r\n\t\r\n\r\n270,274\r\n\t\r\n\r\n6.2%\r\n\r\nSource: CAPA analysis of Air France-KLM results\r\n\r\nSo, in 2015, some labour productivity indicators improved and some deteriorated. Nevertheless, in absolute terms, Air France in particular remains a laggard on labour productivity, compared with other European legacy airlines, and needs to improve significantly.\r\n\r\nAir France-KLM is right to put labour productivity improvement at the heart of its plans.\r\n"},

You have long-haul low-cost in every part of the world,\u201D de Juniac said,  citing Singapore Airlines, Air Canada and Lufthansa as carriers that have started operations with this model. \r\n\r\nHe said that initially the long-haul startups were \u201Cnot convincing,\u201D but that they are becoming increasingly so. \r\n\r\n\u201CSo we have to see whether or not, and if it\u2019s possible, to do something in Air France-KLM. But the key priority is to solve the mainline competitiveness problem.\u201D\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Air France-KLM remains committed to growing its short-haul, low-cost subsidiary, Transavia, as part of its ongoing Transform 2020 restructuring plan. The division has two airlines\u2014Transavia Holland, and Transavia France.\r\n\r\nThe LCC\u2019s total capacity, measured in available seat kilometers (ASKs), is scheduled to increase 15% this year after growing 5.3% in 2015. The main contributors to this year\u2019s capacity growth again will be Transavia France, which last year increased its ASKs by 24.6%, and the March opening of Transavia Holland\u2019s new Munich base. It initially will have four Boeing 737-800s operating 101 weekly frequencies to 18 destinations in summer.\r\n\r\nMunich is a relatively expensive airport in terms of charges, though de Juniac maintains the operations there will have lower unit costs than those of Transavia in its home markets. That is because the airline has negotiated a contract for Munich-based crew, particularly pilots, that is less expensive than agreements with Transavia Holland and Transavia France individually. The Munich operation\u2019s only ground staff will be one person coordinating operations, he said. Transavia Holland will manage operations, meaning there will be no additional overhead or administrative costs in Munich. De Juniac also noted that Munich is a high-income area, and that \u201Cthe price of the average ticket is higher than it could be in other areas of Germany or Europe in which the average purchasing level is probably lower.\u201D\r\n\r\nTransavia France last year became Paris Orly Airport\u2019s largest international LCC, according to de Juniac. The LCC was able to grow at France\u2019s second busiest airport, thanks to the transfer of slots to Transavia from Air France. Air France CEO Frederic Gagey believes this was \u201Creally a good strategy. It\u2019s clear that by operating this transfer of slots from Air France to Transavia, we have kept our good position into Orly.\u201D This summer, Transavia France will be operating more than 20 aircraft at Orly.\r\n\r\nTransavia\u2019s development in Orly will have a limit, Gagey said. The next step is to develop Transavia outside of Paris, and establish French provincial bases.  This, however, requires an agreement with pilots. Discussions are ongoing.  Transavia Holland pilots  signed a new collective labor agreement last year.\r\n\r\nThe planned ramp-up of Transavia comes despite the fact that the LCC recorded operating losses in 2014 and 2015. Its 2015 loss was \u20AC35 million, \u20AC1 million less than the loss for 2014. Air France-KLM projects the LCC will break even in 2017.\r\n\r\nTransavia\u2019s fleet is set to expand to more than 65 aircraft over the next two years, excluding short-term leases, from 53 aircraft in 2015. Passenger numbers in 2015 rose 5.4% to 10.8 million, and load factor remained stable at 89.9%. Total revenues stood at \u20AC1.1 billion, up 4.1%. Unit revenue per ASK decreased by 1.6%, while unit cost per ASK decreased by 1.8%. \r\n\r\nDe Juniac intends to bring both Transavia carriers under the direct control of the Air France-KLM holding company and under one management team \u201Cto improve the efficiency, to be able to draw all the synergies and to have a more critical mass.\u201D KLM, however, has resisted the move. KLM owns all of Transavia Holland and 40% of Transavia France. \u201CIt\u2019s not a short-term or an immediate issue, but it\u2019s probably a midterm issue, and especially if we want to participate into the low-cost consolidation that should happen in Europe,\u201D he said."},

Yesterday the group\u2019s shares rose 5.3p to 558.5p on the back of falling crude prices.\r\n\r\nRevenues for the airline giant stood at almost \u20AC22.9bn \u2013 13.3pc higher than the previous year, and it expects operating profit will grow by a similar degree this year.\r\n\r\nMore trans-Atlantic flights and the company\u2019s increased number of discount flights pushed passenger revenue up 14.2pc to \u00A320.4bn. The airline carried 88,333,000 passengers last year, up from 77,334,000 a year previously and the surge in numbers means the group is now bigger than German carrier Lufthansa, and is gaining rapidly on Air France-KLM.\r\n\r\nNorth America continued to be the largest part of IAG\u2019s business, with the highest number of passengers, although the group expects a surge in passenger numbers travelling within Europe as the threat of terrorism hits other markets, particularly north Africa.\r\n\r\nThe strong results cap a period of growth for IAG, which was formed in 2011 when British Airways merged with Spain\u2019s Iberia, following a tough restructuring of the business which included heavy job losses at Iberia and cost savings at BA.\r\n\r\nIberia had been struggling before the merger, but lower overheads allowed IAG boss Willie Walsh to return the business to profit. In October, IAG unveiled its first dividend since its formation, and today announced a full year dividend of \u20AC0.20 per share.\r\n\r\nIn August last year, the company bought Irish carrier Aer Lingus, which contributed \u20AC35m to group operating profit last year.\r\n\r\nMr Walsh said IAG had no plans for further acquisitions at the moment, but continued to look for opportunities.\r\n\r\nMr Walsh said it had \u201Cundoubtedly been a good year\u201D but pointed to the challenges arising from increasing volatility in the currency and fuel markets.\r\n\r\nBecause the business pays for its fuel through contracts agreed in advance and in dollars, it is not fully benefiting from the drop in the cost of fuel.\r\n\r\nFollowing the sale last night of London's City Airport to a consortium of three Canadian pension funds - Ontario Teachers\u2019 Pension Plan (OTPP), Borealis and AIMCo - and Wren House, an infrastructure investment vehicle owned by the sovereign wealth fund of Kuwait, Mr Walsh reiterated his threat to pull British Airways jets from the airport if the new owners raise fees.\r\n\r\n\"They should know early on that we would not continue the same amount of activity at London City if they increase the prices,\" he said.\r\n\r\nHe said increased fees would mean increased ticket costs, and that choice in the market would mean customers would vote with their feet."},

	"text":"LONDON, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Airbus Group plans to remain at breakeven on the A380 superjumbo despite the prospect of lower deliveries of the slow-selling jet next year, but is not making forecasts beyond 2017, senior executives said on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nProduction of the world\u2019s largest passenger jet has started to slow to match lower deliveries as Airbus struggles to find buyers amid a shift in demand towards smaller long-haul jets.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn 2015 we had breakeven at 27 (deliveries). In 2016, we will have about the same deliveries as in 2015. That allows us to retain breakeven in 2016,\u201D Finance Director Harald Wilhelm told Reuters on the sidelines of a results presentation.\r\n\r\n\u201CIn 2017, the current (order) backlog suggests slightly lower deliveries than 2016, but at the same time we are working on additional measures to bring the breakeven point down further, with a target to retain breakeven of the programme in 2017,\u201D he said, adding: \u201CAnd then in 2018 we will see where we go\u201D.
