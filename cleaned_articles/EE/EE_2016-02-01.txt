 in march 2016 chicago s museum of science and industry will open an exhibition called brick by brick featuring among other lego creations a 60 foot replica of the golden gate bridge
 the exhibition marries the museum s ability to produce complex ambitious exhibitions with lego s status as a venerable well loved brand that has had a real resurgence in the last five to ten years says matt simpson the museum s chief marketing officer

 for simpson s marketing team building a show around a great product is only half the battle
 the team also has to figure out how to use digital technology to generate interest and add value to the exhibition
 we ll use digital media to do some storytelling at the front end simpson explained
 and we ll look to use digital in fun and new ways that extend the experience
 we may allow kids to design something using digital tools for instance and then create it using 3 d printing
 so you may be using digital tools but your creation isn t trapped there
 in other words the team s strategy takes full advantage of new technology to tell a story and encourage engagement with a brand
 simpson and others at the 2015 kellogg marketing leadership summit emphasize the importance of creating a culture that can embrace innovation and respond nimbly to challenges at a time when digital tools are proliferating rapidly
 the question for organizations is how they can adapt what they do well while also changing what they don t do well says gregory carpenter a professor of marketing and director of the center for market leadership at kellogg
 every organization develops a culture based on past experiences and then they re faced with a new reality
 and that new reality is digital
 to be adept at digital you have to be fast you have to be agile you have to be decentralized and less structured and you have to have more cooperation and trust carpenter says
 the big challenge organizations face is transforming themselves from hierarchical and centralized to more collaborative and trusting
 here are ways companies are looking to master their digital media marketing strategies
 using digital partnerships to create brick by brick the museum of science and industry partnered with adam reed tucker one of about a dozen lego master builders in the world
 the collaboration makes sense logistically reed tucker lives in the chicago area and synergistically since it gives lego and reed tucker a stake in the exhibition s success
 the digital possibilities of this partnership are especially promising
 the museum will enhance its youtube presence market the exhibition and add value for guests and potential guests with short shareable videos that not only document the development of the exhibition s structures but invite lego fans and digital communities to build entirely new creations that become part of the brick by brick story
 the big challenge organizations face is transforming themselves from hierarchical and centralized to more collaborative and trusting

 when marketers step into the c suite four top executives on building credibility with company leadership similarly the global manufacturing and technology company emerson electric has partnered with hank green a musician blogger and science popularizer whose short youtube videos about science have a particularly large following to celebrate its 125th anniversary in 2015
 emerson created a platform on its website that features green s short videos as well as links to articles and updates on science and engineering
 with their mutual goal of encouraging interest in science emerson and green are an easy fit
 their relationship has helped emerson reach a broad audience while also building its identity
 in a three month period in early 2015 traffic to emerson s website spiked from about 25 000 page views to nearly 500 000
 one explicit benefit to emerson has been the growing number of people who visit its careers page resulting in a larger pool of applicants seeking jobs with the company
 in another successful partnership emerson electric collaborated with linkedin and the atlantic magazine on a targeted marketing campaign
 the atlantic curated the editorial content which focused on women and engineering while linkedin used its database to pinpoint recipients
 it s been the single most successful thing we ve done per dollar says kathy button bell emerson electric s chief marketing officer
 the engagement level people reading it sharing it pushing it along is just over the top when you can make the content that precise
 telling the brand story through digital successful companies can offer customers a significant competitive difference by telling the right story
 take the tech industry
 what makes many technology companies so successful is not necessarily that their products are faster or objectively better according to farhad manjoo who writes about technology for the new york times
 instead it is the story those companies tell about themselves that makes the difference
 in many ways apple is the leader in showing how to survive and thrive in a world dominated by lots of choices says manjoo
 a few years ago many people in the tech industry thought that competing smartphones would become so good that people would start ditching the iphone for competitors
 and the reason that hasn t happened is that people have a deep affinity with their iphones
 the story that apple tells becomes part of their identity
 a key to emerson electric s collaboration with hank green according to button bell is the power of digital campaigns to help define and tell a company s story
 the emphasis on storytelling led the company to focus on supporting science education and women in engineering especially on linkedin
 that more general advocacy rather than product centric appeals has helped to define redefine and expose the company s values
 doing something about your corporate character rather than selling is 100 times more effective when you re doing social button bell says because it gets shared and you can t be a shill
 if you re doing social it had better be pure of heart
 otherwise you look like a cheap rug salesman
 in addition to helping you reach the audience you want in a way that comes across as authentic using the most current media channels conveys a powerful message about how committed the company is to staying cutting edge
 creating communal experiences through digital tv and video streaming and on demand services have made it increasingly possible for viewers to watch whatever they want whenever they want to
 this has led to tv audience fragmentation
 but some shows are bucking the trend becoming appointment television by using social media to add value to the experience during the shows original airings
 one of the highest rated shows on network television scandal is particularly adept at doing so its cast and crew use twitter to add commentary in real time during original broadcasts
 there s this communal feeling that people get when they watch while talking to other people and that s lacking when they watch alone manjoo said
 the double edged sword of technology its fragmenting effects and its ability to bring people together presents both challenges and opportunities for organizations
 the museum of science and industry s ongoing exhibition future energy chicago now offers a multi participant simulation game in which teams compete against one another using the same piece of software to design a system of energy consumption production and distribution
 the team that creates the most energy efficient system wins the game
 you can be making a decision across the room that impacts what i see in front of me simpson said
 so what you learn very quickly is the interdependence of all the elements
 the game s fluidity and interactive and cooperative dimensions are a good model for the kind of business cultures that are poised to thrive in the digital era
 in the past developing a strategy was like making a movie where you could script everything says carpenter
 today it s much more like improv and people who are good at making movies aren t necessarily good at improv
 in the more decentralized world leadership isn t about dictating
 it s more about developing a shared vision
 that s one reason you see so many more organizations focusing beyond making money on meaning
 that focus helps everyone feel more connected to the core mission of the organization
