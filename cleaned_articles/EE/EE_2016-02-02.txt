this year has started off rough for the markets
 the s p is down more than 5 as of this writing
 industrial conglomerates such as emerson electric nyse emr and general electric nyse ge have had an even rougher start to the year ge chart ge data by ycharts only honeywell nyse hon is beating the market right now and just by the hairs on its chinny chin chin
 emerson is the worst performer of the lot with a double digit loss so far this year
 but you should think twice before buying it on the hopes of a turnaround
 what s past is past emerson underperformed all of its industrial conglomerate peers in 2015 even managing to lose to the lackluster s p 500 by nearly 22 percentage points ge chart ge data by ycharts but for large stalwarts like these you have to remember that stock price appreciation is only part of the overall investment equation
 there s also the dividend to consider and emerson s is the best in its class company dividend yield as of 1 19 16 emerson electric 4

 of course part of its stellar yield is due to its price declines
 siemens also a victim of poor performance last year has a similarly high yield at present
 but even a high dividend yield can t always make up for poor price performance
 here s a chart of the stocks total returns in 2015 which factors dividends into the equation
 once again you can see that emerson is dead last ge total return price chart ge total return price data by ycharts it s a gas like many of its peers emerson s fortunes are affected by the oil and gas industry
 however emerson differs in the scope of its oil and gas exposure
 its largest segment by far process management has heavy oil and gas exposure servicing oil and gas reservoirs and refineries
 its industrial automation segment also has significant oil and gas exposure
 it s hardly surprising then that these two segments were hit hard in the company s 2015 fiscal year
 process management sales were down 7 yoy with revenue down 22 
 industrial automation fared even worse with sales down 17 and earnings down a whopping 25 yoy
 the company specifically blamed oil prices saying that persistent low oil and gas prices reduced capital and operating spending especially in upstream markets
 this is an industrywide issue with companies such as general electric and honeywell both seeing declines in divisions with high oil and gas exposure in recent quarters
 unlike ge and honeywell however earnings in all of emerson s divisions even those without significant oil and gas exposure declined in fy2015
 the segment that fared the worst for example was network power which saw its earnings halved
 by contrast ge and honeywell have divisions whose performances are helping to offset the negative effects of oil and gas prices on the company s overall results
 no end in sight while ge and honeywell are both anticipating growth in 2016 despite a sluggish economic environment emerson hasn t made any such predictions
 the company had a strong start to 2015 so its yoy comparisons are likely to be negative in the first couple of quarters of 2016 according to chairman and ceo david farr in the company s latest earnings call w e re ready for what i would say the first negative quarter and then the second negative quarter which i believe underlying sales could be down somewhere in the 5 to 6 range and then we ll start coming out both from an easy comparison but also seeing some stability in the markets we serve
 farr sounded optimistic notes but even his optimism sounded well somewhat pessimistic yes our underlying sales were down over 2 
 yes our reported sales were down 9 
 
 the environment is what the environment is
 we deal with it but we re going to try to control what we can control and we re going to control our profitability our cash flow our return and any acquisitions we can get done
 investors takeaway in spite of emerson s stellar dividend and it really is stellar there s not a lot to be optimistic about for emerson in the near term
 when the best you can look forward to is stabilization of yoy numbers because your prior year numbers are so dismal that s pretty weak sauce for investors to stomach
 and if things in the oil markets don t turn around as anticipated yikes
 the outlooks for ge and honeywell seem more upbeat although both are making projections based on optimistic 2016 oil price numbers
 ge is reinventing its entire company by divesting large portions of its ge capital financial business portfolio and selling its storied appliances unit
 honeywell is coming off six consecutive years of double digit earnings growth with predictions that growth will continue
 emerson is coming off an exceptionally weak year with a plan to try to control what it can control
 what you should control are your expectations for emerson in 2016
