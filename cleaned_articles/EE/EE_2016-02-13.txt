they re both big industrial conglomerates
 they both begin with a seven letter word and end in electric
 they both pay a nice dividend
 but there are more similarities than these for general electric nyse ge and emerson electric nyse emr 
 their plans for 2016 are also surprisingly similar
 it s unclear though whether those plans will pay off for shareholders
 a rough start to the year both companies stocks have had a rough start to 2016 along with the broader market emr chart emr data by ycharts
 while ge has been a decent long term performer emerson has lagged the market by a mile during the past five years even when its generous dividend is factored in emr total return price chart emr total return price data by ycharts
 so it s somewhat surprising that ge and emerson are pursuing the same three strategies going forward strategy no
 1 divestitures both ge and emerson are shedding parts of their companies
 ge is selling its appliances unit to chinese company haier and is divesting itself of many of its financial businesses
 emerson meanwhile has divested its commercial storage business and floated the idea of divesting more as well as spinning off its underperforming network power unit into a stand alone company
 for ge the strategy seems to be working at least for now
 divesting most of its financial unit allows it to focus on its core industrial businesses and is generating a lot of cash
 ge plans to apply to the government for de designation of ge capital as a systemically important financial institution which will allow it to return a lot of that cash to shareholders
 and consumer appliances are a low margin business that was sold at a premium price so that s a net positive for the company as well
 for emerson the picture is mixed
 it hasn t released many details about its proposed network power spinoff so it s unclear how it will affect the company s bottom line
 and even without the commercial storage business underlying sales in its commercial and residential solutions unit declined 2 last quarter
 while emerson s network power business has been slumping lately it hasn t been doing as poorly as some of the other company s core businesses particularly industrial automation which saw sales decline 30 last quarter compared to network power s 6 slide
 it s tough to gain advantage by cutting dead wood when even your live wood is rotting
 strategy no
 2 the double down oddly the businesses that emerson and ge aren t spinning off are their oil and gas businesses
 these have been hit incredibly hard since fuel prices began dropping in 2014
 instead of selling or spinning off the oil and gas business though ge is reportedly looking to acquire more of the market by purchasing halliburton s drilling business
 emerson too is hanging on
 on a recent earnings call emerson ceo david farr said clearly we have a challenging oil and gas and industrial marketplace right now but it s nothing new
 we have been there before
 we know what to do to deal with this issue
 whether staying the course is a smart move or not won t be clear anytime soon
 it s possible that oil and gas prices will jump to a full recovery in 2016 reviving orders and reversing the fortunes of ge and emerson s oil and gas units
 it s equally possible that prices will continue to languish or fall even further
 emerson s worse off than ge here though with a larger portion of its business coming from the oil and gas sector than general electric
 strategy no
 3 cut baby cut both companies have identified cutting costs and restructuring as a way they intend to juice profits in the face of weak energy prices
 emerson s farr said the energy market is why we started the aggressive restructuring last year
 i f the market continues to get challenging we will continue to do additional restructuring
 in a recent interview ge s cfo jeff bornstein said nearly the exact same thing
 he announced that ge was doubling its 2016 restructuring budget to 3
4 billion with an emphasis on oil and gas
 the company will also move its headquarters to boston from connecticut to avoid some state taxes but the actual savings will likely be negligible given ge s massive size and global footprint
 cutting costs is generally an effective way to increase profitability
 the only downside is that cutting costs too much can impede business growth
 it s a fine line to walk but the seasoned management teams at emerson and ge have enough experience that they can hopefully find a happy medium
 emerson s farr has been ceo since 2000 and ge s ceo jeff immelt has been ceo since 2001
 the foolish bottom line low oil and gas prices coupled with an uncertain economic outlook for 2016 have caused problems for both these companies and their shareholders
 however while ge predicts modest growth emerson is predicting declines
 both companies are trying to execute the same three strategies to weather the storm but it s not going to be easy
 there s nothing either company can do about energy prices so short of selling their oil and gas units altogether which would leave emerson without much of a company all they can do is cut what costs they can and cross their fingers
 until oil and gas prices recover though neither company s stock is going to perform the way shareholders would like
 and even then emerson s track record of underperformance may continue
 you may want to steer clear of these stocks until such a recovery begins
