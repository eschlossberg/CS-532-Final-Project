london royal dutch shell became the latest big energy company to file a damage report on the impact of depressed oil prices saying on thursday that its adjusted profit fell 56 percent in the fourth quarter of 2015 compared to a year earlier
 but the company s stock rose about 5 percent in amsterdam trading as shell said it would maintain its dividend paying out at least 1
88 a share for 2016
 promising to continue to pay dividends which some other big petroleum companies have also pledged to do is one of the few ways to reward investors during the industry s lean times although some analysts question how long the payouts can be sustained if oil prices continue to languish
 shell said earnings adjusted for inventory changes were 1
8 billion down sharply from 4
2 billion in the comparable period of 2014
 for all of 2015 its earnings fell 80 percent to 3
84 billion compared with 19 billion in 2014
 on a conference call with reporters on thursday ben van beurden shell s chief executive said that the pending acquisition of the british oil and gas producer bg group which is expected to be completed in a few weeks would be an opportunity to further streamline shell s operations as it adapts to the changing energy industry

 27 2016 mr
 van beurden said that shell had already cut about 7 500 full time and contractor positions and that an additional 2 800 jobs would be eliminated from the two companies after the merger
 he also promised impactful decisions on matters like capital spending
 in an immediate move to preserve capital shell said it would postpone two major projects a liquefied natural gas operation in canada and a deepwater oil and gas development off nigeria
 we are making substantial changes in the company mr
 van beurden said as we refocus shell and respond to lower oil prices
 shell s diminished earnings came as conocophillips the third largest american oil company announced that it was slashing its dividend by two thirds and that it posted a 3
5 billion loss in the fourth quarter compared with a net loss of 39 million the year before
 conocophillips is the largest american oil company so far to cut its dividend in another sign of extreme stress which has already led to scores of bankruptcies of smaller companies
 low prices for oil and natural gas were responsible for a drop in conocophillips revenues of 42 percent to 6
8 billion
 the company also wrote down the value of its oil properties and exploration assets by 2
2 billion
 since it spun off its refineries more than three years ago the company no longer receives any benefits for lower oil and natural gas prices which make refining more profitable
 while we don t know how far commodity prices will fall or the duration of the downturn said ryan lance conocophillips s chief executive in a statement we believe it s prudent to plan for lower prices for a longer period of time
 chevron last week reported its first quarterly loss since 2002
 bp on tuesday reported a 3
3 billion fourth quarter loss
 exxon mobil on that same day said that its profit for the quarter had declined 58 percent
 oil prices what to make of the volatility over the last two and a half years the oil industry experienced its deepest downturn since at least the 1990s
 for shell despite the cushioning effects of its large refining and chemicals business the falling prices of oil and gas are still doing damage
 each 10 a barrel change in the oil price the company says has an impact of about 3
3 billion on annual earnings
 shell had forecast gloomy earnings two weeks ago before the vote by shareholders on the proposed acquisition of bg
 a few days later investors approved the acquisition
 shell estimated on thursday that its reserves of oil and gas still in the ground and under the sea floor fell by 1
4 billion barrels in the past year to 11
7 billion barrels as falling prices had prompted the company to remove some of them from its books

 that is one reason shell has been intent on acquiring bg group which would add an estimated 3
6 billion barrels of reserves
 shell produced 1
1 billion barrels in 2015
 with petroleum prices down about 70 percent over the last 18 months the oil industry is experiencing its most brutal downturn since the late 1990s
 that period a time of widespread job losses among oil companies was a time of industry consolidation as bp acquired amoco and exxon merged with mobil
 back then shell stayed on the deal making sidelines
 but during the current downturn the company has been the only big oil company to make a bold move in buying bg groupfor cash and shares now worth about 50 billion
 that deal proved divisive with investors some of whom worried about shell making a large takeover at a time when oil prices were still on the way down
 mr
 van beurden has long tried to persuade investors that the bg acquisition is not an expensive gamble but rather an opportunity to choose the best of both companies and to cut jobs and expenses like exploration
 bg will also raise shell s status as europe s largest oil and gas company
 but that distinction may be difficult to celebrate at a time of falling fuel prices
 big oil companies have responded to plummeting prices by cutting capital spending and operating expenses
 but with prices lower than most forecasts analysts and rating agencies are beginning to argue that shell and other companies may need to go much further
 on monday the credit rating agency standard poor s downgraded shell s long term credit one notch to a from aa and put five other european oil majors including bp and the french company total on watch for similar potential downgrades
 in explaining its downgrade of shell s
 p
 said it expected the company to generate significantly less cash than it planned to pay out in dividends and capital expenditures through 2017
 the agency also said that shell might be further downgraded after the completion of the bg acquisition
 we now believe many major oil and gas companies current and prospective core debt coverage metrics are likely to remain below our rating guidelines for two or three years as the industry adjusts to lower prices s
 p
 said in a statement
 the pressure on the companies earnings also raises questions about whether they can continue to pay the generous dividends that are now a crucial attraction for investors particularly if prices remain in the current range of 30 a barrel or even lower
 bp in announcing its big loss on tuesday said it would continue its 10 cents a share dividend but planned to review it each quarter
 in a note to clients on wednesday biraj borkhataria an analyst at rbc capital markets in london wrote that 2016 is likely to be a year of transition for bp with limited ability to cover its dividend unless oil prices rose substantially
 so far most oil company chiefs have stuck by their commitments to continue paying dividends
 but the dividends which cost the companies billions of dollars each year and were set when oil was selling for more than 100 a barrel could prove hard to sustain
