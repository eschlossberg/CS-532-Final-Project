summary oil prices have continued to fall sharply reaching a 12 year low on january 20 and it is not clear if the 19 rise in brent crude oil indicates a bottom
 oil price will eventually recover
 however investing directly in oil by future contracts will cause part or all the profit from price appreciation to be lost due to contango conditions
 investing in a supermajor integrated oil gas company like royal dutch shell will give investors a significant price appreciation when oil prices recover along very generous dividend yielding 8
4 
 shell has a strong balance sheet and it has been able to generate a positive free cash flow in 2015 of 0
9 billion
 despite the extremely low oil price in the fourth quarter shell s upstream operations have shown earnings of 0
5 billion
 oil prices have continued to fall sharply reaching a 12 year low on january 20 and it is not clear if the 19 rise in brent crude oil and 10
2 increase of wti crude oil since then indicates a bottom
 however oil price will eventually recover sooner or later
 as no one has anticipated crude oil plunging 70 in a year and a half it is impossible at this moment to determine when oil prices start to climb
 however we can try to get some conclusions from the previous crash in oil prices due to the global financial crisis in 2008
 wti crude fell 63
1 in less than eight months from an all time record of 143
28 a barrel on july 03 2008 to 52
90 on february 19 2009
 however after one year on july 02 2009 wti price climbed 40
8 from february bottom and after three years on july 01 2011 the oil price was 79
5 up from 2009 bottom as shown in the table and charts below
 of course current global economic conditions are different for the better and the same pattern has not been repeated
 however commodities prices are moving in cycles and lower capital expenditures on exploration and production will eventually cause oil prices to rebound
