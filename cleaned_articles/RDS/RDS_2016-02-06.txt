at first glance this looks like a terrible time to buy energy stocks
 oil prices are at historic lows demand has pulled back inventories are climbing and global manipulators like opec and iran are doing little to help
 but contrarian investing is successful because we invest against the herd and simple first level notions
 i warned you to stay away from big oil when the goo was trading 50 higher and i hope you listened
 but oil prices will eventually find a bottom and it s almost time to get our big oil shopping list ready
 the s p 500 pays just 2
3 but the firms i m talking about pay from 3
9 all the way up to 8
7 
 and these management teams take their dividends seriously they continue to reiterate their commitments to keeping their payouts
 conocophillips cop cfo jeff sheets recently said that our top priority is the dividend
 a compelling dividend is a core element of our value proposition and we think it is still appropriate
 unfortunately for mr
 sheets bad economics trumped his top priority
 yesterday conoco announced it lost 3
5 billion in the fourth quarter and it ll be slashing its dividend by more than 60 
 who will be next to drop the dividend i ve got a few likely candidates in the sector
 but first let s talk about the safest payout even today
 exxon mobil corporation xom reported brutal fourth quarter earnings this week
 revenues fell 31
5 and earnings plunged 58 lower
 that s an earnings decrease of 501 million versus the prior quarter
 in the fourth quarter of 2014 the company realized a price of 63
30 per barrel of crude and 3
72 per cubic foot of natural gas
 but last quarter exxon only received 34
36 and 1
80 respectively for the same fuel
 that s a 45 lower for crude and a 51 lowered in natural gas
 lower profits mean less cash and exxon has tapered its share buyback program reduced its capital expenditures by 25 and shored up its financing
 this will help the firm fund its dividend and acquire cheap assets
 the company added six new major start ups in 2015 and plans to have six more in 2016
 exxon ceo chairman rex w
 tillerson commented the scale and diversity of our cash flows along with our financial strength provide us with the confidence to invest through the cycle to create long term shareholder value
 exxon pays a 2
92 dividend good for a 3
9 yield
 the firm has increased its dividend to investors for 33 consecutive years
 even last year the company increased payouts by 6
7 
 the stock sits below 75 a share and is just 20 lower than last year impressive resilience given the energy price crash
 this is the most secure dividend in big oil
 exxon s 61 payout ratio represents its highest since 2002 and it s higher than the 50 i normally require but this dividend is in the best shape of any
 the next three companies are all losing money at the moment which means they boast negative payout ratios
 chevron corporation cvx announced a fourth quarter loss of 588 million
 that s not surprising given its average realized price for crude was 38
71 for the quarter versus 68
32 for the same barrel a year earlier that s a 43 sales haircut
 the real story behind chevron is a number of larger capital projects coming online and a repositioning of the firm s assets and portfolio
 the first shipments of lng from its australian gorgon facility will start soon while three additional major projects at chuandongbei lianzi and moho nord came online last quarter
 now these projects can start making money instead of being capital drains
 chevron s total spending for last year dropped 12 to 61 billion and the firm expects to cut outlays another 18 in 2016 with the completion of these projects
 chevron s stock is down 22 from its high last february and currently sits at 81
 the company pays a 4
28 dividend for a 5
3 yield
 at the last quarterly conference call chevron s chairman and ceo john watson said our number one financial priority is to maintain and grow the dividend
 we have a strong balance sheet for precisely transition times like this
 problem is as long as the company is losing money these payouts are likely to be funded by additional debt
 i respect the dividend dedication but i don t like to see unprofitable firms sharing profits that are non existent
 until chevron gets its finances in order investors should avoid this yield mirage
 bp plc adr bp delivered an even uglier fourth quarter report
 net income dropped 90 to 196 million
 bp currently pays a 0
60 quarterly dividend yielding 8
3 
 surprisingly the company announced that it will maintain the dividend for the first quarter of the year
 bp has taken a number of aggressive restructuring charges over the last five quarters totaling 1
5 billion with another 1 billion planned for 2016
 the company s cost measures have helped decrease operating costs by 3
4 billion mostly in efficiency savings
 additionally the company will slash 7 000 jobs this year
 it seems that bp was barely out of their horizon deepwater oil spill disaster which has cost the company upwards of 65 billion when they were hit with a crumbling oil market
 however the fear of the litigation costs and global scrutiny these past few years may have given the company a jump start on belt tightening
 of the major oil producers bp is in the weakest financial shape
 to be honest it should have cut its dividend already
 over the last 12 months it lost 2
49 per share while paying out 2
40 in dividends
 how d it bridge the gap with 5 billion in additional long term debt
 the royal dutch shell plc adr rds
a and bg group plc adr brgyy merger which looked liked such a win win for everyone has grown a bit complicated as the deal nears completion
 the premium has shrunk as have the benefits of the merger with prices under 90 a barrel
 however there are still some takeaways for investors to breathe easier about
 first shell has never cut or suspended its dividend in 40 years
 that includes the late 1980s when oil was at 10
 and despite a 56 drop in fourth quarter profits the firm has reiterated it will maintain its dividend for 2016
 the firm has delayed capital expenditures and cut spending
 it plans to slash another 3 of its employees this year after the merger
 the shell bg merger increases shell s reserves by 25 and its output by 20 
 more importantly it makes shell a well positioned producer of lng a segment that is growing internationally as oil declines
 the merger takes shell from third to the second largest public oil producer by capitalization after exxon
 shell currently pays an 8
4 dividend
 the merger only improves the bottom line and its ability to pay dividends as bg is profitable
 but as with every energy firm not named exxon i d wait for the dust to clear on this one
