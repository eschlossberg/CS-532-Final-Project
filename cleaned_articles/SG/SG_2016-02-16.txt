could the asian infrastructure investment bank aiib suffer collateral damage from china s territorial claims in the south china sea the risk is clearly there
 the aiib plans to make its first loan as early as the middle of this year
 that s about the same time a un arbitration tribunal in the hague is expected to rule on the philippines appeal against chinese territorial claims to virtually the entire south china sea
 should china reject arbitration and or the standing of established international fora for south china sea dispute resolution china risks painful blow back
 given the political cover of such precedent aiib borrowers could feel emboldened to renege on aiib loan repayments
 china could then find itself lacking international political support in enforcing penalties having itself rejected respected forms of multilateral dispute resolution
 for decades china s been the recipient of large scale inward investment
 as a result china could write and capriciously change rules
 but in coming years china increasingly will be on the other side of the ledger
 that s because china s multi decade accumulation of a us 3 trillion reserve hoard is now economically destabilizing
 the aiib was created to put this reserve hoard to work
 the goal has been to maintain employment levels in china s now world competitive infrastructure state champions
 these companies like state grid corp of china and china national overseas oil company cnooc are now among china s largest employers
 given that china s internal infrastructure needs are now largely met these state champions now need overseas contracts to avoid politically destabilizing layoffs
 shifting from inward investment recipient to outward global investor represents a huge change for china
 it will force a change in chinese thinking
 at present china believes neighboring countries either are or should be an extension of china where rules are what the communist party says they are
 china s south china sea nine dotted line is a manifestation of this
 it rests upon two retroactive fictions undocumented assertions the line has existed since ancient times and undocumented claims of its indisputability
 given this potential aiib borrowers can t help but wonder whether similar standards may be applied in dispute resolution over aiib loans
 could land beneath aiib funded chinese built infrastructure in third countries be retroactively claimed indisputable chinese territory aiib borrower due diligence now must include evaluation of the above risk
 already china s infrastructure state champions like state grid corp
 of china and china national overseas oil company cnooc are experiencing blow back along these lines
 take vietnam and the philippines
 both have clearly benefited from chinese inward investment
 but both also are pushing back
 vietnam now trades electricity across its border with southern china
 vietnam s also considered a potential route for the proposed 40 billion kunming singapore railway
 china and vietnam also have agreements to cooperative manage fisheries and energy exploration in the tonkin gulf
 but at the same time china s cnooc has placed a huge oil and gas exploration rig three times in waters claimed by vietnam sparking anti chinese riots in vietnamese cities
 china s state grid similarly has suffered blow back in the philippines
 in 2008 state grid won a pivotal contract to upgrade and operate the philippine electricity grid under a 25 year contract
 last year the philippines summarily expelled chinese state grid technicians and replaced them with filipinos
 the reason undocumented philippine allegations of a computer virus in the grid
 these two cases among others illustrate the social license and local caprice risk china s been able to disregard during three decades of rapid internal economic growth in which it could set retroactively malleable rules
 the outside world however works differently
 in coming years china must invest overseas to relieve growing internal economic imbalances and keep its populace employed to maintain political stability
 this presents opportunities for borrowers and risks to china
 ultimately china s power to enforce loan repayment on stroppy host countries may be hindered by chinese precedents in claiming such obligations to be retroactively discretionary
 translation the strategic gaming advantage now lies with aiib borrowers
 this should moderate chinese behavior and lead to a greater appreciation of compromise
 in the south china sea joint development areas offer a way to solve this problem
 look for progress along these lines in 2016
