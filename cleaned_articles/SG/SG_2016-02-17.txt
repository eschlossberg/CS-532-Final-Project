milan feb 17 reuters italian power grid company terna is ready to work with shareholder state grid corp of china on projects outside europe as it moves to diversify its business and offset lower returns from core regulated operations
 terna one of europe s biggest power grid players makes the lion s share of its money from returns set by the regulator and designed to allow it to improve the country s high voltage transmission grid

 terna which runs around 64 000 kilometres of power lines in italy said 3
3 billion euros would be invested over the next 4 years to improve the domestic grid and links to europe
