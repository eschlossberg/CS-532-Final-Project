as the winter transfer window deadline day for the premier league passed manchester city made the footballing world stand up and take notice when the club confirmed that pep guardiola would be taking over from current manager manuel pellegrini at the start of the 2016 17 season
 another move greatly discussed but that failed to materialise was that of brazilian attacking midfielder alex texeira s from ukrainian club shaktar donetsk to liverpool
 the next day the defending i league champions mohun bagan lost their afc champions league qualification match by a margin of six goals
 apart from football what was the other major factor connecting these three events china
 untitled 1 copyuntitled 1 copy while bagan lost to shandong luneng third in the 2015 chinese super league csl the 26 year old texeira moved to jiangsu suning ninth in the league last season for a sum of 50 million euros
 but suning s new found riches after being acquired by the suning commerce group in december 2015 has seen it smash the chinese transfer record twice during the window with brazilian midfielder ramires also signing for the club from chelsea for a reported sum of 28 million euros
 shandong luneng on the other hand are owned by the shandong electric power group a subsidiary of the state grid corporation of china
 like luneng and suning most csl clubs are owned or controlled by state backed corporations or realestate companies
 the other team to break the chinese transfer record during this window guangzhou evergrande have a story which runs parallel to the rise to csl itself
 relegated in 2009 after a matchfixing scandal which rocked chinese football they were bought over by the evergrande real estate group which pumped in funds overseeing the club winning five consecutive domestic titles from 2011 to 2015 and the afc champions league in 2013 and 2015
 guangzhou spent heavy money in this period recruiting players as well as managers
 among the last three men to take charge of the first team have been world cup winning managers marcelo lippi and luiz felipe scolari as well as a world cup winning captain fabio cannavaro
 the other majority stakeholders in guangzhou are jack ma s alibaba group which owns 40 
 with the government wanting to see sports grow as a significant contributor to the gdp in the wake of an otherwise slowing economy along with president xi jinping s personal interest in the game investment in football is seen as a politically smart move and a good business opportunity making football a more lucrative asset class by the day
 on december 1 2015 shortly after xi s visit to manchester city in october a consortium led by china media capital cmc and citic group which also controls the csl club beijing guoan bought a 13 stake in city football group for 400 million
 this was the latest in a series of high profile chinese investments in other european clubs the others including atletico madrid sochaux ado den haag and malaga
 cmc also recently clinched the global broadcast rights of the csl over the next five years for 1
3 billion a 20 fold increase on the previous deal
 after the match fixing scandal an overall reform plan had been announced in march 2015 by the state council general office
 the football association would have no administrative ranks inside and the number of elementary and middle schools featuring football would increase to 20 000 by 2020 and 50 000 by 2025
 plans with long term goals of bidding for hosting the world cup and bettering the standards of the national team with the ultimate aim of winning the world cup were also set in motion
 the national team which last played in the 2002 world cup and ranking 93 on the fifa list won all their group stage matches in the 2015 afc asian cup before eventually losing to hosts and eventual champions australia
 while comparisons with the recruitment policies of the mls and the isl cannot be helped there are three significant factors that make the csl differ from these two emerging leagues
 the average age of foreign recruits is far less which means the players are not totally past their prime and are far more competitive
 there are only five slots for foreign players with one of those slots for a player from an afc country and the goalkeepers have to be chinese thus aiding the development of young chinese talent and their ability to pay astronomical salaries to the foreigners means that only a handful of european clubs have the financial might to match the chinese clubs
 questions still remain about the outcome of this newly found momentum that chinese football has gathered
 will there be a discernible improvement in the national team five years from now will there be new calls for further reform separately once xi jinping retires will that have any bearing on the current push for reform will his successor embrace these changes as much but for now chinese football enjoys its moment in the sun
