 when the chinese took over the las bambas copper mine here in the andes mountains in 2014 beto chahuayllo at first barely noticed the change
 he kept on painting buildings at the mine a job he d been doing for four years in hopes of saving enough to leave his village and his dirt floor hut and move his family to nearby cuzco where the houses have electricity and his children could attend a better school
 the new owners a conglomerate of chinese state owned companies bought the mine while it was still under construction paying 5
85 billion to the swiss firm that had started developing it
 the peruvian government welcomed the new investors predicting that las bambas a gray gash across the mountains set to be second biggest copper mining operation in the world would boost peru s gross domestic product by 1

 but china s investments in the region have increasingly met resistance from the people whose voices register least in the global economy
 one day in the nearby provincial capital of tambobamba graffiti appeared on a white construction barrier
 in bold red letters somebody wrote say no to the chinese
 it was an early sign of the trouble that would soon engulf the communities around the mine
 the protests against it would eventually cost chahuayllo his life

 in latin america china found a new supply of commodities to help fuel its monumental economic growth
 and in china latin america found a way to ride the coattails of that growth
 between 2001 and 2013 china s total investment in latin america and the caribbean grew from 1 billion to 86 billion as state owned companies slurped up oil from ecuador and venezuela soybeans from argentina and brazil and copper from chile and peru
 the investment helped drive the strongest economic performance that latin america had seen since the 1970s with gdp growth averaging roughly 3 a year
 finance ministries loved it and so did the heads of state said kevin gallagher a professor at boston university who studies chinese investment in the region
 that was especially true in the wake of the world financial crisis of 2008 when exports to the united states and europe fell
 china became this new growth pole gallagher said
 but as china and latin america have deepened their relationship not everybody has been so welcoming
 in honduras in 2013 the indigenous lenca people blocked access to the chinese backed agua zarca dam which they said was in their territory sparking clashes with local security forces

 four days later his bound and battered body was discovered in an unmarked grave
 and since the chinese state run firm shougang acquired an iron mine in 1992 in marcona on peru s southern coast the project has been beset by near constant unrest over environmental concerns and labor conditions

 the conflicts in some respects reflect growing pains
 many chinese companies are still learning how to navigate diverse politically complex countries far from home said cynthia sanborn vice president for research at the university of the pacific in lima peru s capital
 when you re in countries that are both democratic and tumultuous those that have diverse civil societies with diverse needs you have to deal with them she said
 the learning curve is steeper and they have to learn things that other companies learned generations ago
 china believed its newest copper mine was a test it could pass
 las bambas was supposed to be the poster child for responsibility in new mining sanborn said

 noah fowler for the los angeles times china s interest in the mine is clear
 the country is addicted to copper last year gobbling up as much as the rest of the world combined to cast into pipes for new cities and wire into consumer electronics to ship around the globe
 peru the world s third largest producer of the metal is one of the biggest beneficiaries of that addiction
 while china still invests far less than the u
s
 in latin america and the caribbean on the whole its stake in peru is three times larger
 las bambas was to benefit not only peru but also the communities around the mine
 in some ways it has
 starting under swiss ownership the mine has boosted the local economy and helped modernize the region
 when we got in there in 2004 there wasn t even currency people would exchange goods in the market said luis rivera a peruvian and las bambas vice president of operations
 no banks no phones no ids
 we had to establish a bank mobile phones the internet
 the mine became the largest employer in the apurimac region which has one of peru s highest poverty rates
 it put 18 000 people to work directly and indirectly during its construction
 the new owners led by 62
5 stakeholder mmg a melbourne australia based subsidiary of china minmetals corp
 built a town known as nueva fuerabamba for villagers displaced by the mine
 compared with the surrounding villages it is a model of progress with freshly paved roads 441 sturdy yellow houses a health clinic running water and three churches each for a different christian denomination
 we also give them a relocation bonus compensation for the lifestyle they have to leave said socrates cornejo a las bambas community relations officer
 but the mine has brought little benefit to many others who live near it and their discontent was mounting
 chahuayllo a leader of the committee that represented his tiny village in meetings with mine officials and the government started hearing concerns that pollution from the mine could threaten the local fishing and farming industries
 residents were worried about the possibility that chemicals might seep into surrounding rivers and the mountainsides
 they seized on two major changes the new owners with the blessing of the peruvian government made to the original plans
 first the chinese added a second factory to process deposits of the mineral molybdenum and it seemed precariously close to the challhuahuacho river
 second rather than build a pipeline to send the copper concentrate to the pacific port of matarani the company decided to haul it by truck raising fears of endless dust and toxic spills along the 450 mile route
 more immediate than those complaints was another once the mine started producing copper more than three quarters of the jobs created during the construction phase would disappear
 the company came with many promises of money opportunities and work said roselle chihualro chahuayllo s brother
 but we have been cheated
 a local politician rodolfo abarca accused the mine of failing to provide infrastructure and agricultural investments it had promised
 why do we have this big project here this very important project and we are still poor he said recently
 chahuayllo started attending meetings of workers
 they wondered how they could have their voices heard either by their own government or the chinese executives who spent most of their time outside of peru

 noah fowler for the los angeles times brewing anger turned to a labor strike and open protest last year
 for three days in september 36 year old chahuayllo his brother and thousands of other poor peruvians gathered on the outskirts of challhuahuacho a ramshackle town at the foot of the mine
 his wife agustine llusca aguilar stayed home with the five children to tend their horses lambs and guinea pigs
 the shouts of the protesters echoed in the surrounding hills swelling into a dull roar
 some waved sticks and slingshots
 a few flicked cigarettes into the dry grass sparking small fires that sent wisps of smoke into the bright blue sky

 on the third day of the protests as tensions rose they fired tear gas into the air
 some people were trying to run away some people were crying and some were insisting on attacking the policemen with the slingshots chihualro recalled
 he said his brother trudged uphill toward the police raising his hands and chanting with the crowd let s negotiate
 then shots rang out and he fell
 when his brother reached him blood was gushing from a bullet wound on his right side
 brother wake up please chihualro said he pleaded
 chahuayllo died that evening at a nearby clinic one of at least three protesters villagers say were shot and killed by police

 later that month the chief executive of minmetals he wenbo met with the peru s deputy minister of mining in beijing
 according to the company he promised that mmg would fuel the development of the local communities in peru
 rivera the las bambas executive said that the protesters had some legitimate grievances about labor and environmental issues but he declined to go into detail
 the peruvian government has agreed to hold workshops in the area to discuss local communities environmental concerns
 several dozen locals have refused to leave their old stone and mulch homes and move into nueva fuerabamba the newly built neighborhood
 one of the holdouts porfirio gutierrez paniura said the compensation package was too small
 we have more land more animals and more things to lose way more than the people who left he said
 we were ok with the mine paniura said
 but we want them to understand that we have our richness and that it has its price

 noah fowler for the los angeles times china s demand for copper continues to rise even as its economy has been slowing driving down world commodity prices and rippling through latin america economies which are expected to contract slightly this year
 last month mmg announced that las bambas made its first shipment sending 10 000 tons of copper concentrate to china
 the mine is expected to produce 450 000 tons of copper annually for the next two decades
