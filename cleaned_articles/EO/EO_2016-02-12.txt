 in the charity s most significant comments since the scandal broke a week ago a defiant dianne jeffrey defended age uk s commercial activities which brought in more than 100m last year more than double the donations it attracted
 age uk has been under scrutiny since it emerged that the charity was promoting an energy package from e

 the charity made more than 6m in commission from e
on last year part of a multimillion pound commercial operation that includes tie ups with insurance firms and funeral providers

on and age uk urged to refund pensioners over fuel deal read more however jeffrey said age uk had done nothing wrong
 a person would feel the need to apologise if they had done something wrong we are clear we haven t done anything wrong she said
 the only thing i would apologise for is the upset to our staff our volunteers and for those people who rely on us for information and advice
 jeffrey said that media coverage of the charity s commercial operations had been confused and confusing 
 she added as with all these things it is bound to have resonated with the public and of course that is very sad but you know it has helped to showcase the great deals that age uk has and it has made charities very defiant and resilient
 i hope confidence begins to rebuild very soon
 our indication is that very few people have cancelled or called up to say what is going on when reporting is getting exaggerated or is scurrilous people realise that and move on and we are hoping that people move on
 we are clear that accusations are misleading unfair and not right and that will come across in the next few weeks
 the charities act what you need to know read more jeffrey a former nhs trust chairwoman and the deputy chancellor of the university of derby made the comments despite mps and campaign groups lambasting the age uk and e
on tie up and calling for customers to be refunded
 she said criticism of the partnership had focused on price to the detriment of other benefits
 our customers don t say price is the be all and end all it is quality of service aftercare terms and conditions and special conditions
 so even if charity trading arms can t be the cheapest they can make sure it is best for customers which we do she said
 i think it was the best deal for our customers
 people will have saved considerably more than if they had been on standard variable package and furthermore they could switch for free of charge and have alerts from e
on on other deals
 jeffrey who said she is on the two year fixed tariff deal said it represented a very good and outstanding deal for customers
 age uk launched the product in december 2013 with a market leading rate and has monitored prices across the industry every month since then she added
 there were two price cuts to the tariff since its launch
 nonetheless age uk and e
on announced they were postponing the promotion this week although jeffery insisted the timing was not linked to the criticism the charity has faced
 the deal was due to come to an end last tuesday 9 february and e
on informed us they can no longer offer us a two year fixed tariff for customers and they were increasing the price for one year so we decided it was no longer market leading and reasonable she said
 i feel sad that elderly people now can t get that deal that age uk had negotiated for them
 jeffrey also claimed that critics do not understand how age uk s commercial arm works
 age uk enterprises operates separately from the charity and its offers are therefore not subsidised by age uk she said
 instead age uk enterprises subsidises age uk with the profits it raises invested into charitable causes
 however there has been unease at the scale of age uk s commercial operations
 five years ago a collection of local age concern charities split from age uk over concerns about commercial arrangements it wanted to impose on them
 jeffrey said she was proud that age uk was ahead of other charities in generating funds from alternative sources
 the government has called on charities to be more business like so they are not reliant on hand outs and donations she said
 it is important to have a variety of income streams to make sure the charity does not run out of money
 but age uk spends a significant amount to generate the commercial income
 the accounts of age uk enterprises show that while it generated 48m in revenue last year it handed over just 8m in profits to age uk
 its costs included more than 5m in wages for just over 170 staff
 jeffrey defended the salaries at age uk saying nobody who works solely for the charity earns more than six figures
 it is different in the trading arm because it needs to make a profit and we need people with expertise
 we need to pay the going rate to keep good people on board
 jeffrey added that age uk was not planning to make changes
 obviously we will be looking to see if we can improve things and what we can do better but off the top of my head i can t think there is anything we would change without deep consideration she said
