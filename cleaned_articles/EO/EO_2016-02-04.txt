the sun newspaper said energy deals offered by age uk with supplier e
on may have been much more expensive than the cheapest offers from the firm
 the energy regulator ofgem and the charities commission are to examine the deals
 age uk rejected the allegations while e
on said its tariffs were competitive
 in return for selling its energy deals the sun alleged that age uk had received about 6m from e
on
 generous the sun claimed that age uk recommended a special rate from e
on which would typically cost pensioners 1 049 for the year 245 more than its cheapest rate in 2015
 it also alleged that age uk received about 41 from energy supplier e
on for every person signed up
 age uk s accounts indeed show that it received 6
3m in income from energy deals in the year to april 2015
 but the charity said the commission was typically only 10 per customer
 we strongly reject the allegations and interpretation of figures said a spokesperson for age uk

on s website appears to show that its one year tariff is 176 cheaper than the age uk deal switching option the charity said its two year fixed tariff was the cheapest deal on offer when it launched in january
 it said customers were free to choose the one year option but many preferred the reassurance of a two year tariff
 e
on said the sun had made a comparison between two different types of tariffs
 the age uk two year tariff has no exit fees
 according to e
on s website this deal should currently cost an average user 948 a year
 e
on s one year fixed tariff which has a 60 exit fee should cost 772 176 cheaper
 image copyright age uk analysis simon gompertz bbc personal finance correspondent like any charity age uk needs cash to fund its charitable work
 but by delving into the cut throat business of selling gas and electricity it has exposed itself to embarrassing criticism
 its two year fixed rates may have looked like good deals when they were launched
 but once cheaper offers appeared customers were bound to start complaining that a charity should have been making sure they were paying as little as possible
 and should it be earning millions of pounds in commission well price comparison websites do
 however the fact that age uk was receiving the money will have come as a surprise to some of the older people who were relying on its recommendations
 in the end age uk and e
on s energy offer raises the question of how we want our charities to be raising funds in these difficult times when donations are hard to come by
 as soon as you become a sales operation there is a danger that people will say you are putting profit before charity
 rough deal 73 year old beth porter from frant in kent now regrets taking out the two year fixed deal with age uk
 sadly i too fell for this so called good deal for pensioners she told the bbc
 as a pensioner of fixed income i really cannot afford to receive notice of my latest dual fuel bill and find it was double what i ve usually been paying
 e
on said our current age uk tariff was the uk s cheapest product of its type in the uk when it was launched a two year fixed deal and when we launched our current one year fixed product it was also the cheapest in the uk
 it added its customers could switch tariffs at any time without any charge being applied and they could sign up to be alerted to potentially better deals when they became available
