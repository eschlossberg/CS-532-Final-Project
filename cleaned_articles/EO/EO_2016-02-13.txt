 revised release follows london 13 february 2016 moody s investors service moody s has today placed on review for downgrade the baa1 senior unsecured ratings of e
on se e
on and its guaranteed subsidiaries e
on international finance b
v
 and e
on beteiligungen gmbh
 concurrently the rating agency affirmed the group s p 2 short term ratings
 a full list of affected ratings is provided towards the end of this press release
 rating rationale today s action reflects e
on s exposure to a weakening power and commodity price environment
 forward baseload prices in germany have declined by more than 20 in the last three months reflecting a decline in commodity prices notably coal and co2 which dropped by 20 and 33 during the same period respectively
 current one year forward baseload prices of around eur23 mwh are below moody s estimates published in june 2015 of a eur30 35 mwh range over 2015
 at the same time prices in the nordic region have deteriorated by around 22 in the last three months
 high hydrology also affects current one year forward baseload prices of around eur18 mwh below moody s estimates published in june 2015 of a eur25 30 mwh range
 e
on has a diversified generation portfolio with around 25 of attributable capacity and 38 of output exposed to outright power nuclear hydro and lignite lower than some of its peers
 nonetheless while we note that outright production is largely hedged over 2016 and 2017 moody s expects greater earnings deterioration from generation as hedges run off in the future
 additionally e
on s russian operations are exposed to lower ruble euro rates which will have an effect on earnings from that region
 the rating review reflects the company s potentially reduced financial flexibility as it takes steps to determine the capital structure of both future e
on and uniper in the context of a volatile operating environment before the proposed spin off of uniper later this year
 moody s notes the considerable efforts taken by the company to reduce debt and improve liquidity over recent years
 resulting in credit metrics of ffo net debt of 23
7 and rcf net debt of 20
1 in 2014 and debt has reduced further in 2015
 nonetheless e
on s ability to maintain a financial profile consistent with a baa1 rating may be hampered by the need to support a stronger financial profile at uniper to mitigate the pressure on its business profile of the recent power commodity and foreign exchange developments
 e
on has a target of an investment grade rating at this entity
 the review will also factor the outcome if known of the deliberations by the nuclear commission appointed by the government to consider a partial or full externalization of funding to cover the industry s nuclear obligations which are to be backed by contributions from the generators
 moody s expects that while a pragmatic solution is sought key credit considerations will be any potential residual exposure of the generators to the somewhat unquantifiable risks relating to final storage in addition to the pace and scale of any such funding
 the rating action takes place in the context of the proposed restructuring of the e
on group that envisages the allocation of the majority of the shares to existing shareholders in the newly established company uniper which will hold the group s power gas up and midstream and commodity businesses
 the networks renewables and customer solutions businesses will remain with e
on which will also retain the associated assets and liabilities in relation to its nuclear generation activities
 the company plans to present the capital structure and strategic plans of both companies to the capital markets in april or may prior to the agm in early june
 moody s expects to conclude the review in the light of this more complete information
 nonetheless it may be a number of months following the agm before the capital structures of both companies are finally implemented
 moody s notes that the transaction might lead to actions from such stakeholders which could also be relevant to the future risk profile of both e
on and uniper
 what could change the rating up down the ratings could be confirmed if the company can demonstrate that it is well on track to establish a financial structure in line with a baa1 rating
 the rating agency is likely to establish guidance for the rating category when further details of any proposed nuclear solution are known
 the ratings could be downgraded if it appears unlikely that an appropriate financial structure for a baa1 rating can be maintained
 this could be as a result of the challenging business environment or if requirements in relation to the prefunding or externalization of nuclear obligations prove unduly onerous
 moody s expects that any downgrade is likely to be limited to one notch and expects to conclude the review within 90 days
 the principal methodology used in these ratings was unregulated utilities and unregulated power companies published in october 2014
