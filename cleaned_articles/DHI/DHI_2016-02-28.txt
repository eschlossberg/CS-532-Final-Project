 following the bank of japan s decision to introduce negative interest rates in january it is feared that asset managers can no longer guarantee japanese investors will get back the savings invested in money market funds
 yields have turned negative on many of the short term assets held by these funds forcing japanese investment companies to stop taking new money from investors
 nomura nikko and daiwa are among those that have turned clients away
 the ultimate survival of the japanese money market fund industry is in jeopardy says vanessa robert senior credit officer at moody s
 japanese asset managers have appealed to the central bank for a special exemption from negative rates in order to overcome their problems
 in the meantime ms robert says these fund companies will quickly run out of viable options to ensure that investors capital remains secure
 around y2tn 17bn is held in money market funds in japan and a further 100bn is in similar money reserve funds which can invest in higher yielding foreign currency securities
 although the japanese industry is relatively small compared with the us and europe where trillions of dollars are invested in comparable funds analysts have looked to europe for guidance
 european money funds have been hit by negative rates for almost two years
 european money market funds faced widespread and in some cases severe outflows when their yields turned negative says alastair sewell a director at fitch the rating agency
 he says money did eventually return to this type of fund but only because investors failed to find palatable positive yielding alternatives 
 the worry is that investment flows are likely to become more volatile in japan according to mr sewell
 he believes the smaller asset base of japanese money market funds means they are less likely to retain sufficient cash to remain viable
 y2tn 17bn amount held in money market funds in japan
 a further 100bn is in similar money reserve funds the investor base in japan is much smaller and the variety of products much leaner than in europe which could heighten problems
 ms robert adds that european asset managers were quick to adopt new flex mechanisms that allowed them to maintain a constant 1 a share net asset value even when short term yields were negative
 flex mechanisms permit managers to cancel or redeem share classes if yields remain negative
 but because the japanese government s introduction of negative rates was so swift and took asset managers by surprise they have not had time to develop similar solutions
 it is also unclear if such arrangements would be acceptable
 solutions that surfaced in europe to deal with negative rates are unlikely to be accepted in japan says ms robert
 some are more optimistic about the fate of japan s money funds
 jason granet head of international cash portfolio management at goldman sachs the us bank says negative rates will not spell the end for japanese money funds
 but investors will recalibrate their expectations for returns on cash
 mr granet points out that the dublin domiciled yen money market fund run by goldman sachs has operated with negative rates for more than a year and has continued to attract positive inflows from investors
 he adds that goldman has not weakened credit standards or attempted to hold riskier assets to boost the returns of its money funds
 our focus remains on liquidity and the preservation of capital
 safety still rules at the end of the day says mr granet
