 very tight supply of hotel rooms continued over the entire course of the peak season partially due to a very early bulk selling of hotel rooms to travel agents

22 million visitors between february 7 and february 14 inclusive

 the airport management said on february 13 the airport set an all time record for daily passenger volume and flights with 29 000 passengers processed and 204 flight movements
 we believe the larger tourism arrivals in macau reflect favourably on macau s focus to diversify its economy and develop itself into a destination market
 it would also bode well for macau gaming s paradigm shift that is increasingly driven by mass over the long run said a note on monday from brokerage sanford c
