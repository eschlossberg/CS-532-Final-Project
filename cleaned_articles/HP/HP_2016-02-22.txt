 tweet this scaling iot networks building a networked system of connected devices is currently very difficult as individual devices are often based on proprietary standards or they meet a range of industry standards that are not interoperable
 this can make it impossible for devices to share information and it limits the capability of an iot network
 the collaboration addresses this issue by enabling devices to be centrally identifiable accessible and manageable
 this will be achieved by hpe using arm mbed iot device platform connectivity solutions that integrate all device hardware and software manage operational deployment and facilitate analysis of device intelligence
 the highly scalable solution is built on open standards and utilizes chip to cloud device security offered by mbed technology
 it will allow enterprises to benefit from accelerated time to market and lower cost of ownership
 our iot technology partnership with arm can revolutionize connectivity moving forward said dave sliter vice president and general manager communications media solutions hpe
 the collaboration has the potential to bring new iot solutions to market quickly and accelerate adoption in the enterprise of smart connected technologies
