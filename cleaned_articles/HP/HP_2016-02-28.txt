 meg whitman the ceo of hewlett packard enterprise and an early backer of chris christie s presidential campaign just publicly blasted the new jersey governor for endorsing republican front runner donald trump via an email sent to reporters
 calling trump a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears she called christie s bombshell endorsement friday an astonishing display of political opportunism and called on christie s supporters and donors not to follow him into the trump camp
 christie s endorsement on friday is being viewed in the circles of the republican establishment as a major stab in the back by someone once considered one of its brightest stars
 before suspending his campaign christie had hammered at trump saying a vote for the new york billionaire equated to a vote for democratic front runner hillary clinton
 whitman s statement is probably the strongest yet by a mainstream republican against christie and exposes a growing sense of alarm about trump winning the nomination
 she s a highly respected republican operative and fundraiser who was considered a potential vice presidential running mate by mitt romney in 2012 and john mccain in 2008
 she backed christie last july and signed on as his national finance co chair along with ken langone the billionaire co founder of home depot and the hedge fund manager steve cohen
 she was returning the favor for his support in her unsuccessful run for california governor in 2010
 she even hosted christie at her atherton calif
 home for a 2011 fundraiser benefiting his new jersey republican state committee at a time when he was being pressed to contest romney for the gop nomination
 now she s free to back another candidate but notably didn t do that with this statement
 stay tuned for that
 there are hints in this new york times story that a republican establishment effort to confront and derail the trump campaign at the gop convention in cleveland this july is gaining momentum
 here s whitman s full statement chris christie s endorsement of donald trump is an astonishing display of political opportunism
 donald trump is unfit to be president
 he is a dishonest demagogue who plays to our worst fears
 trump would take america on a dangerous journey
 christie knows all that and indicated as much many times publicly
 the governor is mistaken if he believes he can now count on my support and i call on christie s donors and supporters to reject the governor and donald trump outright
 i believe they will
 for some of us principle and country still matter
