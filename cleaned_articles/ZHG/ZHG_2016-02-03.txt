 when ezubo was named online credit financial brand of the year by china s national business daily in 2015 jiang was comforted
 the 60 year old investor who asked that cnbc not use her full name had been reluctant at first to put money into the fast growing anhui based peer to peer p2p lender
 i had doubts at the beginning jiang said
 but many of my friends and their families had invested in ezubo
 i saw the company s advertisements and awards on china s state media and other channels so i thought it was real
 instead ezubo was allegedly running the largest online fraud yet seen in china
 jiang who invested 150 000 rmb 22 800 in ezubo in mid 2015 just a year after the company launched is one of more than 900 000 private investors apparently scammed by the company

 according to xinhua ezubo attracted investors with promises of annual interest payments of 9 14
6 percent in return for funding leasing projects but instead used the money paid in by new investors to pay off earlier ones in what xinhua described as a classic ponzi scheme

 in addition xinhua said ding paid huge salaries to the company s employees the company paid 800 million rmb 121
6 million to employees in november 2015 alone and insisted all secretarial staff wear designer outfits and expensive jewelry to burnish the company s image of profitability
 but tightening cash flow and unusual transactions by ezubo triggered an investigation by chinese authorities in december xinhua reported
 the investigation included the use of two excavators to recover more than 80 bags full of paper accounts that had been buried six meters underground by the ezubo s executives
 calls for supervision now ezubo s burned investors are pessimistic about recovering their money
 in china it s extremely difficult to claim money back under such scenarios jiang said
 the prosecution process is not transparent and procedures are very confusing
 like many critics on chinese social media jiang said she was deeply disappointed with the lack of official supervision companies like ezubo recieved as well as the government s failure to compensate fraud victims

 one chinese p2p investor who asked to remain anonymous told cnbc there were as many as seven micro lending companies in my neighborhood selling financial products with extremely high returns of 30 to 40 percent
 you would seriously question the credibility of these businesses but there was no supervision from the government the 53 year old investor said
 he lost almost all his savings 3 million rmb 450 000 after investing into a p2p company named sichuan fortune union which now faces similar fraud charges as ezubo
 business man near window op ed china s disappearing billionaire effect there are very few wealth management channels in china and our stock market is extremely risky said the investor
 for ordinary chinese people who don t have fully financial knowledge but want to invest such products are very attractive
 in december the china banking regulatory commission cbrc laid out draft controls on online p2p companies including a requirement to register with local financial regulators and disclose information on borrowers and other risks
 and xinhua reported last month that chinese authorities were working with bank regulators to set up a warning system for financial risks
 but this is little comfort for investor jiang
