corporate family rating upgraded to b2 from b3 
probability of default rating upgraded to b2 pd from b3 pd 
us 90mm senior secured revolving credit facility upgraded to b1 lgd3 from b2 lgd3 
us 630mm senior secured 1st lien term loan b upgraded to b1 lgd3 from b2 lgd3 
us 200mm senior unsecured notes upgraded to caa1 lgd5 from caa2 lgd5 ratings rationale emerald s b2 cfr reflects its leverage of 5
4x including moody s standard adjustments as of ye 2015 and the highly cyclical nature of the tradeshow business
 the company operates in ten different end markets although there is a significant concentration to both the gift home general merchandise manufacturing and sports apparel divisions
 in addition approximately 37 of 2015 revenue was derived from its top five shows
 there is also sensitivity to long term disruptions in air travel which would negatively impact performance
 the company generates over 90 of revenue from tradeshows and conferences with the remaining revenue coming from lower margin print publications and digital products lines
 the limited print exposure which is in secular decline reduces the risk of converting print revenue to digital that has been a challenge for many companies
 emerald also benefits from high margins strong free cash flows a good liquidity position and growth in the event business following the 2008 2009 recession
 leverage has improved from material debt repayment in 2014 and 2015 as well as from organic ebitda growth and from acquisitions
 moody s anticipates that emerald will have good liquidity over the next 12 months supported by strong free cash flow a cash balance of 16 million as of q4 2015 and an undrawn 90 million revolver due june 2018
 the term loans are covenant lite and the revolver is subject to a 6x net first lien leverage test if the revolver is more than 25 drawn
 the company has the ability to incur incremental secured debt in the amount so that the total net first lien secured ratio does not exceed 4
5x plus 100 million
 the 200 million senior notes due 2021 become callable on june 15th 2016 at 104
5
 the stable outlook reflects moody s expectation that emerald will continue to generate good free cash flow and grow revenue in the low single digits
 ebitda growth is expected to lead to modest deleveraging over the next year although financial policy is anticipated to have a significant impact and could lead to additional deleveraging
 an additional upgrade is unlikely in the near term given the recent upgrade
 moody s could upgrade the ratings if the company maintains good liquidity generates a strong free cash flow to debt ratio of over 15 and grows ebitda or reduces debt such that leverage is sustained below 4x
 confidence that the private equity owners would maintain leverage below 4x would also be required as would positive organic revenue growth
 moody s could lower the ratings if leverage is sustained above 5
75x due to economic weakness poor operating performance or a debt funded shareholder friendly transaction
 negative free cash flow or a weak liquidity position would also lead to negative rating pressure
