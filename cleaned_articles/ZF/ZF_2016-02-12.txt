nine speed transmissions are here to stay
 they re being touted as a fuel efficient selling point in vehicles such as the 2016 honda pilot in top of the line touring and elite trim levels
 but these transmissions are also something that might take some getting used to
 one aspect of these teething pains can be seen in the behavior of our pilot elite tester which demonstrated a trait best described as funky
 while coasting into a stoplight the transmission downshifts and the engine revs higher in the lower gear as it should but the 4 317 pound suv momentarily lurches forward
 it shouldn t nor do the peculiarities end there
 first gear is a mere starting point or creeper gear as the nine speed flicks out of first between 5 mph to 7 mph quicker than you can say something like shift that s not unusual for a nine speed but shifting up to the next gear while gently accelerating results in the transmission hunting for the next gear for a long second
 under moderate or aggressive acceleration the tendency isn t as noticeable
 but if you were to try to soothe baby to sleep by driving slowly around the block for example there would be a pronounced jerk that would result in one fussy baby and one angry car shopper who just dropped 50 000 on an otherwise great all wheel drive alternative to the minivan
 the odd sensations may be the driver needing to adjust expectations to new technology
 a visit to piloteers
org one of the leading honda pilot consumer message boards shows fewer complaints about the transmission in a december thread than in a july thread about the same trim line
 brian weinberg director of retail operations at a chicago area honda dealership admitted the new technology takes getting used to
 i drove one and i noticed the difference but i ve never driven a nine speed before he said
 of the 10 complaints filed on www
safercar
gov the recall arm of the national highway traffic safety administration none are for honda s new nine speed transmission
 at this point there hasn t been a service bulletin davis adams honda product spokesperson said of the voluntary notices automakers issue to dealers to fix or address a mechanical quirk
 technical service bulletins or tsbs are not mandated by nhtsa and are not recalls
 if this is a major concern and critical mass to confirm it then honda will be quick to remedy it
 the pilot transmission tuned differently is also in the 2016 acura mdx where it has drawn criticism from consumers
 just returned from dealership because of the jerkiness in shifting harsh downshifting and all around horrible transmission behavior posted gemesq in an april 2015 post on the mdx forum mdxers

 nine speed transmissions provide better fuel economy with more precise performance
 the nine speed transmission manufactured by zf friedrichshafen ag for honda and acura uses 16 percent less fuel than a 6 speed at constant speeds although they take some getting used to
 zf also designed the troublesome nine speed transmission in the jeep cherokee when it launched for model year 2014 and for other vehicles made by fiat chrysler automobiles such as the chrysler 200 sedan and fiat 500x crossover
 the hundreds of complaints on www
safercar
gov included remarks about lunging rough shift changes and even disengagement
 fca ceo serigo marchionne admitted to automotive news on feb
 2 2015 that fca had to do an inordinate amount of intervention on that transmission
 fca ordered successive software updates or reflashes to fix the problem at the consumer s request
 fca launched a brand new transmission on the wrong vehicle said larry vellequette who covers fca for automotive news
 new transmission new engine with a disconnecting rear drive system it s a hugely complex piece of machinery
 reluctant to talk about the new pilot s transmission since he hasn t driven it vellequette added that fca used zf s design but that fca built the transmission itself
 honda on the other hand let zf build the nine speed transmission in its vehicles which include the acura mdx
 different automakers using the same transmission does not make the same results
 we didn t put the pilot out as quickly as chrysler did with the jeep adams said
 this is the most modern version of the software so we have better expectations
 since nine speed transmissions such as the one used by fca and honda are adaptive they read the driver s inputs and driving conditions to recognize patterns and optimize shift points
 that might explain why consumer message boards are more forgiving and dismissive of transmission complaints
 the teething period can gnaw at the nerves of consumers who have dropped nearly 50 000 on a new car
 should drivers have new expectations or should they learn to drive differently to avoid a lurching ride i wouldn t recommend an early one vellequette said of nine speed transmissions
 as with any new technology it takes a while to get through the teething pains
