china life insurance company ltd
 nyse lfc lfc china life ins 16
35 2
10 operates along with its many subsidiary businesses as one of the primary life insurance providers in the people s republic of china
 its major insurance divisions include life health accident and business insurance
 in addition lfc has separate asset management and trustee services a major consulting wing and a diversified pool of fund offerings
 lfc has its own investments in retirement properties in china
 as of early 2016 china life employs more than 100 000
 despite relatively strong performance during the three year period from 2013 to 2015 and the five year period from 2011 to 2015 there are reasons to be pessimistic about the near term prospects for lfc
 these include potential overvaluation even in the face of slumping share prices low projected future cash flow and potentially risky balance sheet foundations
 dividends for lfc pay above what low risk savings vehicles pay but still well below the top player in the income market
 dividends per share have been volatile since 2011 generally falling in absolute terms when compared to insurance industry averages
 dividend policy china life paid one dividend a year every year between 2006 and 2015
 the first three of these dividends from 2006 to 2008 were paid in july
 between 2009 and 2015 dividend payments occurred in august although they rotated between the first and fourth weeks of the month
 the dividend for 2015 was payable on aug
 21 the dividend was declared june 8 just two weeks before a 3 1 split was announced
 dividends per share declined by more than 60 between 2010 and 2012 but swiftly rebounded from 18 cents to 32 cents in 2015
 dividends were slightly down over five years although growth was strong over three years
 this trendline matches up with earnings per share eps which declined from 4
40 in 2010 to just 1
95 in 2012 but an impressive 131
8 eps growth from 2013 to 2014 brought eps back to 5
70
 dividends and yields both grew strongly between 2013 and 2015 both very positive indicators for shareholders
 yield climbed from 0
78 in 2012 to 2
84 in 2014 and 2
64 in 2015 although early expectations for 2016 suggest a 0
84 dividend yield
 lower expectations are based on poor return on equity roe in 2015 as well as below industry average return on assets roa and return on capital roc 
 many expect a cooling off from strong earnings growth over a trailing three year period
 dividend coverage and payout ratios during 2015 lfc had a relatively low dividend payout ratio at 29 
 this means a full 71 of earnings were retained by china life
 in a sense this is a positive for the company because it displays the ability to reinvest and grow but it also raises red flags because insurance is not a capital intensive industry
 shareholders might not be getting enough value for their investments
 the company s dividend coverage ratio tells the same story
 dividends for lfc are extremely well covered by net profit at 3
4x coverage the company could conceivably triple its dividend payout without having to expand future earnings
 this signals the potential for growth but frustrated shareholders might feel they are not receiving their dues
 expect future payout to shareholders to increase even chinese companies struggle to maintain 70 net earnings retention and a 3
0x or more coverage ratio
 balance sheet review cash on hand for lfc still trails 2012 totals while current liabilities increased nearly 80 over that period
 as is common with financial firms the market capitalization of lfc is several times higher than the market value of its real assets
 even still lfc trades at significantly higher multiples than the insurance industry average
 on a positive note there was significant revenue growth over the last two quarters of 2015
 a balance sheet review is critical for putting dividend performance in context but it is more difficult to get good data for chinese companies than for domestic companies
 part of the reason is the stringent restrictions placed on foreign investments in the chinese stock market which means chinese companies are less incentivized to offer useful information to american investors
 additionally a lot of information comes from nonreputable and poorly translated sources making it tricky to trust public information
 interested investors should focus on reliable databases such as morningstar barron s bloomberg and even yahoo finance
 good information can also be found through h share class stocks which are chinese companies that trade on the hong kong stock exchange or n share class stocks trading on the nyse and nasdaq
 credit suisse upgrades china life ratings on aug
 27 2015 directly in the heart of the initial chinese stock market collapse multinational brokerage firm credit suisse upgraded two of china s top companies cnooc ltd
 and china life
 each company improved to an outperform rating although the china life boost was more substantial because its prior rating was underperform
 the move signaled a 50 upside potential for the stock going forward
 the news followed healthy value growth according to credit suisse metrics and a strong solvency position
 the latter factor should be crucial for dividend investors companies battling debt concerns are less likely to pay or raise dividends in the future
 another reason for the move was the role of the chinese government which bought stocks directly in the wake of the country s equity crisis in order to prop up asset values
 proactive governments may receive mixed reviews from economists but shareholders generally love them if government involvement favors their investments
 challenges in china the chinese stock market was in a shambles between august 2015 and february 2016
 nearly every major asset class especially equities and real estate grew unchecked for the five preceding years
 this volatility did not really affect the lfc share price
 lfc fell from a high around 25 per share in june 2015 to 15 per share in august 2015 but that was primarily because of a stock split
 share prices actually grew throughout the chinese stock market crash and into november
 unfortunately for lfc stockholders appreciation did not last
 from november 2015 to the end of january 2016 lfc fell from 18
30 to 11
97
 naturally yield grew from 1
69 to 2
64 over the same period
 fortunately for china life the challenges in the chinese market do not appear to inhibit its earnings projections or future dividend payments as much as many of its contemporaries
 major competitors china life competes on a global scale although its primary rivals in the asian insurance markets are china pacific insurance group co
 ltd
 picc property casualty co
 ltd
 and ping an insurance company of china ltd
 lfc has much greater annual revenue than either china pacific or picc but ping an insurance generated more revenue in 2015 the same rankings hold true in terms of net income and eps
 in terms of dividends per share however lfc is much more generous to stockholders
 for example ping an insurance paid four dividends between june 2014 and september 2015 of between 2
8 cents per share and 7
2 cents per share less than one third lfc s average
 among international competitors in 2015 lfc s dividends were comparable to ing group which paid dividends of 13 cents and 26 cents
