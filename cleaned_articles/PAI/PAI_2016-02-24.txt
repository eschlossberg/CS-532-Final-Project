 bloomberg news analysts expect the three key segments of online payments peer to peer lending and online wealth management to grow between 30 and 60 annually over the next three years
 the ability to gain new users easily and cheaply combined with lower competition from non internet finance providers and the launch of innovative new online to offline products could see china s leading internet finance providers eclipse their u
s
 peers on many fronts argues credit suisse
 the broker argues valuations could increase to levels on par or even higher than those of leading u
s
 online finance stocks which trade at considerably richer multiples
 credit suisse s top picks are internet giants alibaba and tencent 700
hk as well as ping an insurance 2318
hk given their strengths in key parts of the internet finance industry
 the broker likes the companies product innovation and how the growth of their networks is a magnet for other users to join up
 credit suisse recently lifted its price targets on alibaba and tencent on a more meaningful contribution to valuations from their internet finance businesses
 online payments are the most mature segment of china s internet finance industry tracing its origins back to the launch of alibaba s alipay in 2004
 alibaba s head start has allowed it to dominate the cny21 trillion online payments industry with a 58 market share eclipsing the 20 stake held by closest rival tencent s tenpay
 however tencent has been gaining ground despite lacking the customer base alibaba enjoys through its e commerce platform
 tencent has been tapping into wechat s 650 million users to create new payment scenarios such as mobile games online to offline o2o payments and red packet transactions
 credit suisse expects tencent to have a 25 share of online payments by 2018 although alibaba would remain the market leader with 59 share
 the size of the online payments market is forecast to reach cny23
5 trillion for personal computers and cny28
9 trillion for mobile by 2018 which imply annual growth rates of 31 and 48 
 chinese stocks cashing in on internet finance boom internet banks go hand in hand with online payments and both alibaba and tencent have opened virtual bank outlets where users can open term deposits and take out loans
 tencent led the way in 2014 with webank which offers personal corporate and international banking
 the company put its data mining capacity to work in its first webank product a micro lending service called weilidai
 loans do not require collateral or guarantees provided the borrower makes it onto a white list put together by the webank and wechat teams
 weilidai has more than 20 million white list users 660 000 active borrowers and a loan balance of cny7
5 billion
 alibaba s mybank also focuses on micro lending but tends to take on greater credit risk than webank as it lends money from its own balance sheet rather than act as an intermediary between borrowers and lenders
 wealth management is also shifting increasingly online
 the segment is expected to grow at a 30 annual pace and could have cny38
5 trillion of assets under management by 2018
 online accounts for only 3 of the chinese wealth management market but the proportion will increase thanks to china s more technologically savvy young generation
 credit suisse says the bats or china s three internet giants of baidu bidu alibaba and tencent have an advantage in capturing this growth given their long term accumulation of customer resources and platform advantage as well as big data and mobile capabilities
 credit suisse analyst dick wei values tencent s internet finance business at 29
3 billion which breaks down to hkd24
50 a share based on a 2018 estimated earnings multiple of 20 times
 in comparison u
s
 online payments company paypal pypl trades at 17 times 2018 earnings
 others drivers for tencent shares could include better than expected monetization of social media platforms and mobile games sales
 wei rates tencent as outperform with an hkd176 a share price target which is 26 above its current price of hkd140 a share
 wei calculates alibaba s internet finance unit ant financial is worth roughly 59 billion by applying a multiple of 20 times estimated 2018 earnings
 around 80 of the valuation relates to alipay
 the analyst values the e commerce giant s core business at 88
4 a share and has an outperform rating on alibaba with a 96 a share price target which implies 43 upside
 currently fetching 67 a share alibaba trades at 20 times forward earnings which makes it the cheapest of the bats
 alibaba shares have fallen 22 over the past year compared to a 9 rise for tencent shares
 while online payment has the longest history among segments of china s internet finance industry peer to peer p2p lending has attracted the most controversy
 besides a spate of bankruptcies last year a popular p2p lending platform called ezubo scammed more than cny50 billion from mom and pop investors
 however beijing is now clamping down after years of unregulated growth
 the arrival of tougher regulations is expected to spur market consolidation and the growth of p2p platforms backed by leading financial services companies
 lufax a p2p platform backed by insurer ping an is seen to be well positioned to profit from a market expected to grow at a 61 annual pace to be worth cny1
8 trillion market by 2018
 lufax s share of the p2p market is expected to double to 16 by 2018
 like tencent s weilidai lufax manages risk by crunching big data sourced from credit agencies and ping an s database of insurance clients
 lufax s largest shareholder is ping an which has a 44 stake
 currently at around hkd33 a share ping an is down 47 from its peak last june and trades at 1
5 times book value which is near a five year low
 besides lufax ping an also has exposure to internet finance through zhongan insurance a joint venture with alibaba and tencent that is the first chinese property insurance company to sell all of its products online
