 however the deal triggered concerns in the european commission that it would drive up prices for companies and consumers
 ball said last week that it expects to close the merger in the first half of 2016 after receiving conditional regulatory clearance in europe
 the two companies have offered to sell 12 plants across europe 10 of which make cans and two produce can ends
 four of the factories are in germany and three in britain
 separately ball is selling about eight sites in the united states and several in brazil also due to antitrust concerns
 ball and rexam as well as the potential bidders either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment
 the assets on the block are expected to post 420 million in annual earnings before interest tax depreciation and amortization this year and may be valued at up to eight to nine times that in any potential deals the sources said
 peers trade at an average multiple of nine times their expected core earnings
 while strategic players are often able to outbid private equity groups in auction processes due to their ability to reap synergies from a merger the buyout groups may have an edge in this sale speed
 the seller needs to have security that the deal goes through smoothly to make the bigger merger work
 and companies like silgan may have antitrust issues of their own which could delay any deal one of the sources aid
 the source added that in ardagh s case debt levels may be an issue
 the ireland based group last year pulled a planned initial public offering of its cans business which would have reduced its 4
8 billion euros of net debt and it may now shy away from taking on too much additional leverage to finance another acquisition
