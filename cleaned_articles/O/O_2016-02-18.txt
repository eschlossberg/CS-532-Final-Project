com content ad0550de d3d1 11e5 829b 8564e7528e54 a new leader in global drinks can making may soon be crowned but the realm it will inherit is looking smaller than once hoped
 one year since ball corp unveiled a 4
4bn takeover of its uk listed rival rexam to form the world s largest maker of metal drinks containers the us industrial group is preparing to sell off a significant number of assets to secure the deal
 to comply with competition rules in places such as europe and brazil ball is likely to sell assets that produced combined revenues of 2
5bn in 2014
 that is far above the threshold of 1
6bn in revenues that ball specified as a potential deal breaker when it announced the takeover although its figure referred to potential us and european disposals
 ball is currently seeking approval for the deal from us competition authorities
 it s a lot of divestitures
 they have to sell assets equivalent to 40 per cent or potentially more of what they re acquiring that s a big deal says mark wilde analyst at bmo capital
 according to people familiar with the plans the assets for sale generated 420m in earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortisation last year
 that amount is equivalent to more than one fifth of analyst expectations for the two groups total in 2016 according to bloomberg data
 despite the size of the disposals needed ball s management has been unwavering in its commitment to the transaction according to people close to the deal
 its move for rexam will merge two of the three leaders in the global canning industry giving the combined company significant scale
 according to estimates by analysts at baird the new entity would have almost half the market share in north america 39 per cent in europe and 57 per cent in brazil
 it would also own a superior portfolio of manufacturing facilities that combines the companies complementary geographical footprints
 rexam has better exposure to the more growing geographies and specialty cans says chip dillon analyst at vertical research partners
 the growth and future is multiple can sizes and varieties as opposed to the standard can
 for example the uk group is strong in emerging markets such as brazil russia india and the middle east while ball has a presence in china vietnam and myanmar
 a greater geographical spread could help offset the decline of sweet carbonated drinks in ball s home us market as well
 pressure to consolidate has also intensified from customers
 since the ball rexam tie up was announced a year ago ab inbev launched the world s biggest brewing takeover with a 71bn bid for its rival sabmiller
 this merger is both offensive and defensive argues ghansham panjabi of baird
 they see customers getting bigger 
 
 
 and the point is to make sure they won t get bullied by them in the long term 
 people close to ball have argued that a deal will allow the merged company to pass along some of the estimated 300m in annual cost savings to its customers which will include drinks companies such as pepsico ab inbev and red bull
 but others have questioned whether a reduction in competition can be good in the long term
 last month ball agreed to sell off 10 european factories most of its metal beverage packaging operations there as well as two rexam plants
 two plants will be sold in brazil and final clearance from the us federal trade commission is expected before the end of june subject to further divestitures
 such will be the size of the disposals that they will instantly rank as the third biggest competitor in the sector
 recent progress with regulators seems to be winning over investors who are displaying increased confidence that the deal will complete the spread between ball s offer price and where rexam shares are trading has narrowed from around 13 per cent in october to just 3 per cent this week
 and the price of walking away remains steep
 a break fee payable to rexam is equal to about 7 per cent of the deal value or around 300m higher than the usual amount acquirer s commit to in deals
 high break fees like this are there when the target cannot see its way through the regulatory process say analysts at olivetree securities
 this is a classic example
 rexam has done a good job protection its shareholders given the likelihood of a complicated antitrust process
 along with us approvals a remaining concern is how much value ball can extract from its disposals
 smaller rivals and private equity funds are circling
 buyout groups as apollo and onex already own assets in adjacent industries while other firms including blackstone and cvc would like to enter the market
 the wild card is the multiple of earnings they will get for the plants they re going to sell says mr wilde
