 dual class share structures are fundamentally unfair they leave the subordinate shareholders unprotected and cry out for a response from securities regulators
 proponents of such structures call up the success stories fairfax onex but rarely do they focus on the incontrovertible truth that dual class share structures undermine corporate governance standards because the subordinate shareholders carry a lopsided share of economic risk relative to their ability to influence the corporation s affairs
 in particular these shareholders cannot elect directors approve financial statements appoint auditors or ensure change through their vote
 their rights are meaningless in the face of the proportionately greater risk they bear
 dual class structures thus undermine existing accountability mechanisms in the corporate statute
 because the jurisdiction of securities regulators is founded on investor protection and the public interest dual class structures should be further regulated if not prohibited in capital markets
 why dual class firms and the holders of the superior voting shares should not be permitted to enjoy the benefits of going public without the commensurate economic burden
 a primary purpose of going public is to give the corporation access to funding from the public at large
 it is unfair to allow corporations to enjoy these benefits without also taking on the corresponding burden of adequate protection for public shareholders
 proponents of dual class structures use a caveat emptor argument investors are not unfairly treated given the disclosure to which they are entitled including information about the firm s capital structure
 while non voting shares have their drawbacks there is a price at which the market is willing to accept the drawbacks
 but dual class structures insulate management and the board
 they are detrimental to outside shareholders because they undermine accountability mechanisms built into the corporate statute including the ability to elect directors
 shareholders carry the financial risk without the corresponding voting power to alter the board or effect change
 in short dual class structures favour insiders who have fewer checks on self dealing and an unfettered ability to define executive pay bonuses and stock option plans
 they preclude subordinate shareholders from mounting successful challenges to the leadership of a public corporation as well as fundamental changes that it seeks to implement
 they therefore open the door to entrenchment allowing senior officers and directors to shirk their duties or divert profits
 presumably dual class structures are permitted because they represent free contracting between investors and the firm
 but the relationship is not simply contractual it has a securities regulatory overlay premised on the principle of investor protection
 as the supreme court of canada has held securities regulators have a duty to act in the public interest and to protect the public on a prospective and preventive basis
 when put into practice this mandate does not allow securities regulators to overlook acts of the public corporation that silence investors by preventing them from participating in corporate decision making
 securities commissions must then do more to protect subordinate shareholders in dual class firms
 if securities regulators are unwilling to ban dual class shares altogether they should consider the following options
 first regulators should require that issuers subject their dual class structures to a sunset provision
 once a company goes public the structure would be permitted to remain in place only for a limited time unless subordinate shareholders vote to retain it
 second recalling the controversial collapse of the dual class share structure in magna international inc
 regulators should subject the terms of any buyout of the dual class firm to procedural safeguards including a majority of the minority vote a fairness opinion and a mandatory recommendation of a special committee of the board formed for the purpose of evaluating the transaction
 finally in change of control transactions regulators should ensure that at a minimum all shareholders have a number of votes proportionate to their economic interests
 a similar rule is warranted in the case of changes of control by means other than a takeover bid such as a proxy contest
 remember not all dual class firms are run as well as fairfax and onex take bombardier
 reforms are needed to ensure that all shareholders remain on a one to one footing regardless of the proposed change of control transaction and the means by which it occurs
 that would be a good start
