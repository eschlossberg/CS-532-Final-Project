what shares of honda motor company nyse hmc dropped 12
4 in january opening the month at 30
86 and closed at 27
02 on january 29
 so what honda along with most of its major global rivals was caught in a broad sell off of auto stocks that happened after analysts projected roughly flat growth for the u
s
 new vehicle market in 2016
 that plus growing concerns about a slowdown or even a recession in china led to fears that the current growth cycle for autos might be coming to an end
 honda is also suffering from the high costs of a series of huge recalls related to defective airbag inflators from longtime supplier takata
 the company has already recalled nearly 25 million vehicles around the world and the recalls are expected to take a roughly 2
6 billion bite out of its earnings for fiscal 2016
 now what honda s shares have been slumping for much of the last two years
 that s only partly because of the takata recalls honda has also been fending off concerns about its sluggish efforts in china and its so so sales gains here in the united states
 still i d hesitate to call honda a buy even at current prices
 its dividend yield is still a relatively meager 2
64 and its own expectations for sales and profit growth are modest
 it s still a strong and healthy competitor but i think there are better options for investors picking over beaten up auto stocks right now
