honda is in the midst of an aggressive product launch with five all new models and two substantially revised vehicles hitting showrooms in less than 2 years
 many of these vehicles are also top sellers in their respective categories suggesting the automaker s efforts are working to grow honda s visibility and reach in today s highly competitive new car market
 and while honda s overall sales were up modestly 2
6 percent in 2015 at kelley blue book we tracked the brand s transaction price growth at 2
7 percent
 that s higher than chevrolet kia subaru or toyota and essentially tied with mazda s 2
8 percent price growth suggesting the appeal of these new products is creating strong demand

 beyond the upcoming ridgeline truck and odyssey minivan makeovers there s the small matter of honda s small car the civic
 this model has generated big sales numbers for decades and the latest version all new for 2016 will come in more forms than any civic before it
 we ve already discussed the sedan version which hit showrooms last fall and is now leading the compact car segment in sales
 the 2016 civic sedan is a massive leap forward essentially redefining the small car with regard to quality refinement and advanced technology
 in fact it was good enough to win 2016 north american car of year
 now comes the 2016 honda civic coupe featuring all the same goodness in a sportier package

 compared to the sedan the coupe appeals to a younger more active and more educated demographic
 it s also more likely to feed into larger honda models by generating higher brand loyalty
 the expressive exterior design language is clear at first glance with the civic coupe having a 1
2 inch longer wheelbase 1
2 inch shorter front overhang and 5
4 inch shorter rear overhang versus the new sedan
 the roof is also 0
8 inches lower and with the standard 16 inch alloy wheels on a base lx trim 17 inch wheels are standard on ex and touring trims the civic coupe imparts a low and wide stance
 honda civic coupe rear driving photo courtesy american honda motor company like the sedan the civic coupe features two engine and transmission choices
 the base 2
0 liter naturally aspirated four cylinder produces 158 horsepower and 138 pound feet of torque while delivering 30 city mpg 41 highway mpg and 34 combined mpg
 those are class leading fuel efficiency numbers though horsepower and torque is lower than some competitors
 does this mean civic coupes with the base 2
0 liter feels underpowered not in the least
 first the normally aspirated engine provides excellent low end torque and the power delivery through honda s continuously variable transmission cvt is as good as any cvt on the market
 even better is the available and highly engaging 6 speed manual with this engine
 trust us if you settle for a 2
0 liter version of the civic coupe you aren t really settling
