a chinese mining company will begin copper production at a controversial site in central myanmar in may a month after the new government led by the opposition party comes to power a corporate spokesman said friday
 the large mine project operated by china s wanbao mining copper ltd
 company and union of myanmar economic holdings ltd
 umehl a myanmar army owned conglomerate in the town of letpadaung in sagaing region has come under fire by local farmers who have long protested the company s land takeovers in the area
 we will start copper production in may a month after the new national league for democracy nld led government takes power dong yunfei wanbao s spokesman told rfa s myanmar service
 he added that wanbao expected to benefit from good relations with the nld government because party leader aung san suu kyi would make policy decisions based on the rule of law and national reconciliation
 so we believe the country will be more developed he said
 the mine is one of several chinese operated megaprojects under way in the southeast asian nation that have come under fire from locals because of environmental damage and expropriated land
 such protests prompted the ruling union solidarity and development party usdap led by president thein sein in 2011 to suspend construction of the myitsone dam and hydroelectric power development project by the china power investment corporation cpi in kachin state for five years
 dong yunfei however said he wasn t concerned that a similar fate might befall the letpadaung project
 huge projects like this one are planned agreed to and signed by both sides under the full extent of the law and legalities he said
 so everything will proceed according to the law
 inquiry commission aung san suu kyi whose nld party won general elections last november by a landslide had led a parliamentary inquiry commission on the letpadaung project calling for more transparency in the project s land appropriation process and for police riot control training in the wake of a violent raid on protesters at the mine site in 2012
 in 2014 she accused the government of ignoring the commission s recommendations to improve conditions at the mine which she said sparked clashes that december between police and farmers trying to prevent wanbao employees from fencing off land for the project
 the incident left one farmer dead and dozens injured
 the usdp however rejected her claims
 in response to continued protests wanbao canvassed local villages in 2014 and 2015 and met with farmers one on one to try to resolve the issue dong yunfei said
 we are still trying to meet the demands of local people he said adding that wanbao wanted to compensate villagers who had not accepted money the company previously offered them for land it had taken for the mining site
 our doors are open all the time for compensation dong yunfei said
 we suggest that those who haven t taken the compensation come forward
 wanbao offered money to the family of khin win the farmer who was shot and killed during the december 2014 protest to compensate them for their loss but they never showed up to collect it he said
 we heard there was division of opinions among the family members he said
 we don t know the latest situation now

 credit rfa rfa no crop compensation wanbao however has no plan to compensate villagers annually for money they would have otherwise made from crops because the company leased the land from the government not the farmers dong yunfei said
 wanbao and umehl previously said they would pay farmers the highest market rate for crops at the site but locals rejected the offer and demanded the return of their land
 police stopped 200 farmers last month from protesting the company s decision not to compensate them for crops that had been destroyed or displaced
 thwei thwei win a letpadaung farmer and activist told rfa that wanbao has not conducted any further negotiations with locals whose land the company took in the run up to the start of copper production in may
 there have been no negotiations or discussions between residents and the company she said
 the company had not informed locals about anything
 because of this i see no way to resolve the issues between the farmers and the company
 under the new government however letpadaung villagers expect the nld to help resolve the matter with wanbao she said
 we expect the new government will do something for our farmers problems she said
 we also expect to push to the government as well as the company until we finally see results
 no dealings yet but nld party spokesman nyan win said the new government hasn t had any dealings with wanbao yet regarding the letpadaung copper mine
 i think their production plan is according to its own schedule he told rfa
 we have no way making any deals with wanbao because government power has not yet been transferred to our party
 aung san suu kyi must examine whether or not wanbao has implemented the recommendations of the parliamentary inquiry commission he said
 letpadaung can resume production only after complete implementation of the recommendations of the inquiry commission he said
 we don t know whether the implementation has been done but we have the commission s report with the full list of recommendations
 as for the myitsone dam myan win said the nld hasn t seen documents pertaining to the agreements between china and myanmar regarding the project
 there is no transparency and we haven t seen the contracts he said adding that the nld led government would follow domestic and international laws when making decisions about chinese megaprojects in myanmar
 nevertheless the nld will examine such documents before deciding the dam s fate nyan win said
