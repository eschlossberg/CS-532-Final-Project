after decades of false starts solar power in america is finally poised for its breakthrough moment
 the price of solar panels has dropped by more than 80 percent since president obama took office and the industry is beginning to compete with coal and natural gas on economics alone
 related inside the koch brothers toxic empire together charles and david koch control one of the world s largest fortunes which they are using to buy up our political system
 but what they don t want you to know is how they made all that money but the birth of big solar poses a grave threat to those who profit from burning fossil fuels
 and investor owned utilities together with koch brothers funded front groups like american legislative exchange council alec are mounting a fierce rear guard resistance at the state level pushing rate hikes and punishing fees for homeowners who turn to solar power
 their efforts have darkened green energy prospects in could be solar superpowers like arizona and nevada
 but nowhere has the solar industry been more eclipsed than in florida where the utilities powers of obstruction are unrivaled
 the sunshine state has the best solarity east of the mississippi and the third best rooftop solar potential in america
 yet measured by solar production it ranks just 16th in the nation
 it s dwarfed by solar giants like california
 florida even lags behind northern states like new jersey massachusetts and new york
 it defies logic says former florida gov
 charlie crist
 it s absolutely absurd
 the solar industry in florida has been boxed out by investor owned utilities ious that reap massive profits from natural gas and coal
 these ious wield outsize political power in the state capital of tallahassee and flex it to protect their absolute monopoly on electricity sales
 we live in the stone age in regard to renewable power says state rep
 dwight dudley the ranking democrat on the energy subcommittee in the florida house
 the power companies hold sway here and the consumers are at their mercy
 the full political might of florida s ious was on display in december when a deceptive campaign funded by the state s electric utilities crushed a citizen led effort to open florida to solar competition through the 2016 ballot
 when your opponents have no ethical foundation have unlimited resources and are willing to say and do anything to defeat you says stephen smith director of the southern alliance for clean energy which led the pro solar effort it s a tough hurdle to overcome
 it should come as no surprise that the utilities have fought so hard
 the rise of cheap distributed solar power poses a disruptive and perhaps existential threat to the traditional electric utility business
 monopoly electric utilities used to make sense
 dirty power generated at a distance from population centers was carried over a set of transmission lines to homes and businesses
 consumers got reliable power from a single provider
 ious were guaranteed a profit both for building power plants and transmission lines as well as for the electricity itself
 but in recent years the nation s ious have been abusing their monopoly powers to profit from massive infrastructure projects
 utilities more than doubled their capital expenditures last decade costs were paid for by electric customers whose power bills have soared nearly 40 percent
 for investors the formula is simple more infrastructure equals more profit
 the rise of distributed solar power poses a triple threat to these monopoly gains
 first when homeowners install their own solar panels it means the utilities build fewer power plants and investors miss out on a chance to profit
 second solar homes buy less electricity from the grid utilities lose out on recurring profits from power sales
 third under net metering laws most utilities have to pay rooftop solar producers for the excess power they feed onto the grid
 in short rooftop solar transforms a utility s traditional consumers into business rivals
 the surge of solar competition has caught the nation s dirty power generators flat footed the utility trade group edison electric institute eei warns that rooftop solar could do to the utility industry what digital photography did to kodak bringing potentially irreparable damages to revenues and growth prospects
 few industries are worse equipped to deal with disruption than power utilities
 their profits depend on infrastructure investments that pay off over a generation or more
 utilities are structured to be in stasis says zach lyman partner at reluminati an energy consultancy in washington d
c
 when you get fully disrupted you ve got to find a new model
 but utilities are not designed to move to new models they never were
 so they play an obstructionist role
 the sunshine state is a gold mine for its monopoly ious
 air conditioning drives the second highest electrical consumption in the nation the average florida household spends 1 900 a year on power 40 percent more than the national average
 fossil fuel dominates electricity generation florida is 61 percent dependent on natural gas followed by coal at 23 percent
 solar makes up less than one percent of the state s energy mix
 florida solar power opposition solar activists in florida face stiff opposition from utilities
 the power companies hold sway here one state lawmaker says and the consumers are at their mercy
 chris zuppa ap key policies that have spurred a rooftop solar revolution elsewhere in america are absent or actually illegal in florida
 unlike the majority of states even texas florida has no mandate to generate any portion of its electricity from renewable power
 worse the state s restrictive monopoly utility law forbids anyone but the power companies from buying and selling electricity
 landlords cannot sell power from solar panels to tenants
 popular solar leasing programs like those offered by solarcity and sunrun are outlawed
 rooftop solar is limited to those who can afford the upfront expense as a result fewer than 9 000 florida homes have panels installed
 florida s anti solar policies are zealously defended in tallahassee
 it s no secret we play an active role in public policy says mark bubriski spokesman for florida power light fpl the largest iou in the state
 fpl is the monopoly power provider for 4
8 million customers whose electric bills generated 1
65 billion in profit for the company last year
 the utilities are top political donors in florida
 since 2004 the state s four largest ious contributed at least 18 million to state politicians and political committees a preponderance to republicans who now control state government
 in addition since 2007 the companies spent at least 12 million on lobbying employing an average of one lobbyist for every two legislators in tallahassee
 they ve got a pretty good harness on the whole deal up there says crist
 the capital city of florida is more southern gothic than south beach
 tucked away on florida s panhandle tallahassee is a slow walking city of whitewashed churches wide verandas and dusky oaks draped with spanish moss
 nothing from its outward appearance would suggest this city of 190 000 is the seat of power for a state whose economy rivals indonesia s
 a seven hour drive from miami four hours from tampa and another three from jacksonville tallahassee sits at a far remove from the watchful eyes of voters in florida s biggest cities

 i m a big believer that imagination can solve problems says the president florida is served by a part time legislature
 lawmakers make less than 30 000 a year and are subject to strict term limits
 the paltry pay and constant turnover combine to fill the capital with baby faced lawmakers who run point on policy matters in which they have little expertise
 even republicans say the model enhances the power of special interests
 out in eight years says one gop state representative referring to term limits
 you re giving more power to lobbyists
 florida s pay to play energy politics outrage honest conservatives
 nancy argenziano is a 61 year old firecracker of a politician with short dark hair and piercing eyes
 she served as a gop state legislator for more than 10 years
 until 2010 she chaired the state s public service commission psc the arm of the legislature that regulates florida s power companies
 argenziano is unsparing in her assessment the legislature is owned by the utilities
 to me it s extremely corrupt
 the legislature takes millions from utilities who make billions from the decisions of the psc
 they get what they pay for
 the utilities political reach even extends to the governor s mansion a stately brick building graced by a classical portico that only in florida sits a 10th of a mile from a pawnshop where you can turn your gun into cash

 i don t want to give handmaidens a bad name says state rep
 dudley but they re servants of the utility industry
 even as it rolls back green initiatives the psc has rubber stamped fossil fuel boondoggles
 in an unprecedented move it approved fpl s proposal to frack for natural gas in oklahoma
 fpl convinced the psc that the project financed by the electric bills of its customers would save money
 but after a rocky first year the project has already cost ratepayers nearly 6 million
 it s a total rip off says dudley
 dudley has the fire of a reformer
 a tall man who favors pinstripe suits he has repeatedly introduced legislation to curb the abuses of the psc and open florida to solar competition
 but he says he can t even get a hearing in the republican dominated capital
 from a legislative perspective he says we ve really been stonewalled
 seeking to crack open florida s energy market at the ballot box the southern alliance for clean energy sace mounted a 2 million campaign to qualify a solar choice amendment for the 2016 election
 the constitutional amendment would have ended florida s rare lock on electricity sales only kentucky oklahoma and north carolina have similar prohibitions
 it would have freed consumers to install leased solar panels on their rooftops at no upfront expense
 retailers could have installed solar arrays and sold power to tenants in the same shopping complex
 sace is directed by stephen smith a tall tennessean with water blue eyes who dresses like tom wolfe on casual friday
 to advocate for solar choice sace knit together an implausible green tea coalition comprising tea party activists and environmentalists like the sierra club in alliance with florida s retail and restaurant federations as well as religious groups like the christian coalition of america
 the campaign led with voices from the far right
 coalition member debbie dooley helped found the tea party and today directs conservatives for energy freedom
 the 57 year old grandmother may run her shoestring outfit out of the back of a 2010 hyundai sonata but she has an impressive track record spearheading a two year fight that overturned anti solar restrictions in georgia in 2015 creating thousands of clean energy jobs
 at a campaign luncheon in a presbyterian church in downtown tallahassee in november dooley is wearing a lime green suit jacket and matching jeweled earrings and lamenting that she had to leave her chihuahuas chi chi and chico back home in buford georgia
 with a delicious drawl dooley insists that her view is the right view conservatives champion free market choice not government monopolies that stifle competition
 dooley embodies a political trend that many environmentalists don t appreciate says jigar shah the former ceo of sunedison who now runs his own investment firm generate capital
 a passion for solar has taken root among people who may not give two shits about the environment shah says
 the reason debbie dooley is involved is that the tea party people who support ted cruz believe very strongly that the electric utility company is every bit the man as the government is
 solar power florida the view from the magnolia clubhouse in the community of trilogy where homes are using solar energy with panels on rooftops
 octavio jones zuma confronting a popular threat to their monopoly power the utilities fought back with a vengeance
 but rather than campaign directly against the solar choice amendment which polled at nearly 70 percent the ious mounted a competing ballot initiative called the smart solar amendment
 despite the name their amendment doesn t advance the cause of solar power
 quite the reverse it locks existing statute into the constitution says a skeptical republican florida lawmaker
 they ve twisted the words around so that it keeps the monopolies in place former vice president al gore explained at a climate reality project conference in miami blasting the utility initiative as the dumb solar amendment
 even jack abramoff the infamous influence peddler traveled to tallahassee to denounce the utility amendment as right out of the lobbyist playbook
 abramoff who served four years in federal prison is now seeking atonement by crusading against special interest corruption
 the smart solar campaign he says reminds me very much of what we used to do in the old days 
 now it s a fight between two amendments so they can obfuscate what s going on
 the smart solar amendment is financed nakedly by the state s top investor owned utilities which ponied up 4 million through december more than half the campaign s total haul
 we are proud of who supports our campaign says spokeswoman sarah bascom
 other supporters include conservative pressure groups funded by fossil fuel interests
 60 plus a seniors group that has received 15 million from the koch donor network donated more than 1 million
 the national black chamber of commerce nbcc a tiny organization with an oversize name added 100 000
 the nbcc is funded by major polluters including exxon its latest convention was sponsored by koch industries and gulf power
 nbcc founder harry alford unabashed touts the cozy productive relationship we have with the fossil fuel corporations
 the koch grassroots political group americans for prosperity does not appear on smart solar s donor rolls but did issue a call to arms for its florida activists to fight solar choice
 related why we have to kiss off big carbon now as climate change activists pressure public institutions to dump their fossil fuel investments it s becoming increasingly clear that the right thing to do is also the smart thing to do the smart solar campaign played dirty
 in a seemingly transparent effort to confuse petition signers the utility backed measure aped the choice language of the rival pro solar campaign with its formal ballot title
 smart solar called itself rights of electricity consumers regarding solar energy choice
 it s pure deception an exasperated smith tells rolling stone
 many many people have been misled into signing their petition it s fraud bascom insisted there was no intention to mislead
 it would defy all logic she tells rolling stone
 why would we confuse ours with one that does not have public support in the end the utilities crushed the solar choice campaign by spending it into submission
 qualifying an amendment for the ballot in florida is onerous and expensive under the best of circumstances
 it requires nearly 700 000 signatures and any serious campaign hires paid gatherers
 by mounting a competing measure the utilities sparked a financial arms race with the utility backed measure typically paying gatherers twice as much per signature
 when we were paying a dollar on the street they were paying 2 says smith
 when we were paying 2 they went to 4
 soon the ious had forced solar proponents into a burn rate of 350 000 a week
 it was unsustainable
 solar choice threw in the towel in january
 the campaign is now regrouping aiming to qualify instead for 2018 when more than 400 000 signatures it has gathered would still be valid
 smart solar is pressing ahead for the november ballot
 if it passes the utilities will be entitled under the constitution to hit rooftop solar customers with high fees simply to maintain their connection to the grid
 but florida power light isn t waiting until november to take a brazen victory lap
 in january it submitted a proposal to the psc seeking to hike its electric rates by nearly 24 percent over the next three years and asking the commission to reward fpl investors with a higher guaranteed rate of return
 if approved fpl s electric consumers would typically pay an extra 13 a month
 fpl spent millions fighting to deny consumers solar choice says dooley furious
 now they have their hand out asking for a subsidy
 dooley florida solar power tea party co founder dooley has fought for solar and says it represents true conservative values
 david goldman ap florida is an extreme example of utility funded efforts to thwart the rise of solar power at the state level
 but it s not unique
 major utilities across the nation are seeking to undermine competition from rooftop solar by hiking its cost
 the utilities have realized they re completely up a creek without a paddle says shah who sees the utilities lashing out at solar not from a position of strength but of desperation
 they can certainly fight it
 but they re going to lose
 the utilities are working from a playbook developed by alec the koch funded group that promotes model bills often adopted virtually wholesale by republican legislatures and the edison electric institute the utility trade group
 the political argument advanced by alec and eei is that rooftop solar generators are freeloaders on the traditional grid infrastructure they rely on conventional power when the sun isn t shining but because they sell power back to the grid they don t pay much on net
 an alec report on rooftop solar implausibly holds up utilities as champions of the economically vulnerable arguing that net metering creates a regressive tax subsidizing the rich by picking the pockets of the poor
 such arguments ignore the clear value rooftop solar producers create for other customers on the grid including producing power at times of peak demand and adding resiliency against outages
 most obvious rooftop solar producers pay for their own equipment and volunteer their real estate avoiding expenditures by utilities that would otherwise get passed along to ratepayers
 a 2013 study for arizona s largest utility found the benefits of rooftop solar exceed the costs by more than 50 percent
 after some initial legislative setbacks the utilities and their allies are now working in the shadows seeking to persuade utility regulators to put the brakes on solar by in essence taxing rooftop producers
 arizona a state that spends up to 85 percent of the year in sunshine and stands second in the nation with a solar capacity of 1 800 megawatts was ground zero for this approach
 last winter the salt river project srp the utility that serves phoenix hiked fees for rooftop solar customers and tacked on a murky demand charge
 the effect was to increase bills for customers with solar panels by a whopping 50 per month
 srp touts itself as a community based nonprofit
 but in an internal e mail an srp director condemned solar advocates as the enemy
 srp would disavow the comment as a joke
 the utility s price hike puts into action policies long promoted by alec which endorses a fixed grid charge for solar customers
 srp s new fees have throttled the local rooftop market solar lease applications are down as much as 96 percent according to solarcity
 in a scathing open letter ceo lyndon rive blasted srp for working to entrench its monopoly by shuttering the solar industry in one of the sunniest places in the united states
 solarcity is now suing srp alleging violation of federal antitrust laws

 rooftop solar has exploded thanks to bountiful sunshine and a generous net metering law
 today nearly five percent of california s power is generated by rooftop solar
 but this success also triggered a state review of the payments to rooftop producers opening the door for utility monkey wrenching
 the state s biggest utilities lobbied the california public utility commission puc last year to hit rooftop producers with arizona style fees
 southern california edison sought increases averaging 800 a year for its rooftop solar customers
 but in the golden state solar producers are now a formidable political constituency all their own
 in november advocates of preserving the state s net metering program delivered 130 000 signatures to the puc in wheelbarrows
 in december the head of the puc declared the utilities had failed to provide a real basis or evidence to justify the massive rate hikes on solar customers
 in january the puc adopted only minor changes the ruling was hailed as a huge win by the solar industry
 nevada has some of the greatest solar potential in america senate minority leader harry reid touts his home state as the saudi arabia of solar energy

 in late december the state s puc commissioners all appointed by republican gov
 brian sandoval announced huge price hikes for rooftop solar customers
 the changes will add nearly 40 a month to solar homeowner electric bills wiping out the 15 a month in typical solar savings
 the nevada charges were put into effect despite the puc s own admission reported by forbes that rooftop solar customers do not impose any significant additional costs on other ratepayers
 in an unprecedented move the new charges were also made retroactive punishing the state s 17 000 existing solar customers
 until recently nevada was one of the fastest growing solar markets but providers are now fleeing the state solarcity sunrun and vivint are winding down their operations
 this is the first state to close up a solar market eliminating thousands of jobs as we speak says bryan miller vice president of public policy for sunrun
 his company is suing the state promising to expose cronyism between sandoval and the state s biggest utility nevada energy
 noting that the governor s top two political advisers are lobbyists for the utility miller insists this is a story of political corruption
 of course we reject this latest spurious and reckless charge against nevada s state government sandoval spokeswoman mari st

 even as the solar industry faces unprecedented regulatory obstruction at the state level its future on the federal stage has rarely been brighter
 in mid december congress stunned activists solar industry executives and investors by cutting a deal to renew billions in federal support for solar power that had been slated to expire at the end of 2016 avoiding a solar cliff that could have staggered the industry
 signed into law with the 1
8 trillion year end budget the solar accord extends a tax credit that offsets up to 30 percent of solar project costs even as those costs continue to plummet
 the impact is projected to be massive 20 gigawatts of new solar power added over the next five years nearly doubling the nation s output
 but this freakish fit of solar bipartisanship is fragile
 in no uncertain terms the american solar industry will be on the 2016 ballot
 last year the obama environmental protection agency finally unveiled its mechanism to curb the power sector s carbon emissions
 by 2030 the clean power plan would reduce national electricity sector emissions by one third
 under the plan the administration projects renewables like solar will rise to 28 percent of u

 ted cruz calls the clean power plan a radical attempt to destabilize the nation s energy system
 hillary clinton by contrast has promised to build on obama s plan vowing to treat it as the floor not the ceiling
 clinton has an ambitious plan for solar energy
 she calls for the installation of half a billion solar panels in her first term a move that she says would drive a sevenfold increase in u
s
 solar power production
 for his part sanders has not detailed a specific solar policy but has promised massive investments in clean power to drive an 80 percent reduction in emissions by 2050
 over time dooley believes solar power will win out not only on the economics but because there s nothing partisan about it
 in fact she says solar power is one of the few things on which democrats republicans and independents can find common ground
 who doesn t want to be able to have solar panels on their rooftops dooley asks
 who doesn t want to become an entrepreneur selling energy generated on their private property to their neighbors and make a profit off of it other than the monopoly utilities and the koch brothers who have their backs she asks who doesn t want energy freedom
