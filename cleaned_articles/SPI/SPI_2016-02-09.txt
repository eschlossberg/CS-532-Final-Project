 information concerning non gaap measures the terms ebitda and funds from operations per share are used in this press release
 the terms ebitda and funds from operations per share are not recognized measures under gaap
 there is no standardized measure of ebitda and funds from operations per share consequently apuc s and empire s method of calculating these measures may differ from methods used by other companies and therefore may not be comparable to similar measures presented by other companies
 a calculation and analysis of ebitda and funds from operations per share can be found below
 ebitda ebitda is a non gaap measure used by many investors to compare companies on the basis of ability to generate cash from operations
 apuc uses ebitda to assess the operating performance of apuc without the effects of as applicable depreciation and amortization expense income tax expense or recoveries acquisition costs litigation expenses interest expense gain or loss on derivative financial instruments write down of intangibles and property plant and equipment earnings attributable to non controlling interests and gain or loss on foreign exchange earnings or loss from discontinued operations and other typically non recurring items
 apuc adjusts for these factors as they may be non cash unusual in nature and are not factors used by management for evaluating the operating performance of the company
 apuc believes that presentation of this measure will enhance an investor s understanding of apuc s operating performance
 ebitda is not intended to be representative of cash provided by operating activities or results of operations determined in accordance with gaap
 funds from operations per share funds from operations is a non gaap measure used by investors to compare cash flows from operating activities without the effects of certain volatile items that generally have no current economic impact or items such as acquisition expenses and are viewed as not directly related to a company s operating performance
 apuc uses adjusted funds from operations to assess its performance without the effects of as applicable changes in working capital balances acquisition expenses litigation expenses cash provided or used in discontinued operations and other typically non recurring items affecting cash from operations as these are not reflective of the long term performance of the underlying businesses of apuc
 funds from operations per share is calculated based on the weighted average number of basic common shares outstanding
 apuc believes that analysis and presentation of funds from operations on this basis will enhance an investor s understanding of the operating performance of its businesses
 it is not intended to be representative of cash flows from operating activities as determined in accordance with gaap
