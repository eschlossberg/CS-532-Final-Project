chicago ford said thursday that it will launch four all new sport utility vehicles over the next four years in recognition of the growing global popularity of suvs and crossovers
 that s all new entries mark laneve ford s vice president of sales and marketing said at the chicago auto show
 these are in segments of the suv market where we currently do not compete
 so far ford is not saying when or where the new nameplates will be added but it is emphasizing that the products are part of its global plan
 as such the new models could be added either to the automaker s mainstream ford brand or to lincoln
 the suvs could be launched in north america europe asia or south america or in all of those regions
 the dearborn mich
 based automaker also says there are no plans to eliminate any models as part of the plans
 in the u
s
 consumers have been increasingly choosing to buy small and midsize crossovers and the percentage of passenger cars is shrinking
 last year laneve said ford sold 740 000 ford escape explorer edge and lincoln suvs in the u
s
 the most since the early 2000s
 we can t keep them on dealer lots laneve said
 both baby boomers and millennials increasingly prefer suvs and crossovers because they offer more space than a car with the same footprint while also offering improved fuel economy over the suvs of the past
 some suvs now rival the fuel efficiency of v 6 powered midsize sedans from only a few years ago laneve said
 ford says its research shows that once millennials begin thinking about starting a family their interest in shopping for suvs goes up significantly
 while millennials get driver s licenses later than prior generations get married later and graduate from college later they get there laneve said
 and when they do buy cars they prefer suvs
