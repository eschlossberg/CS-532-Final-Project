 images so what ford was caught in a broader sell off of auto stocks that also hit most of its key competitors shares
 investors have expressed concern that new vehicle sales in the u
s
 may be peaking just as china s once roaring expansion seems to be stalling
 there s also concern that established auto industry stalwarts may be at risk of disruption from silicon valley efforts to develop advanced alternatives to their products
 in recent months ford ceo mark fields has moved aggressively to address that latter concern announcing major investments in electrified vehicles and driverless car technology and a new initiative that could lead ford into the ride sharing business
 but some analysts have been skeptical of ford s efforts suggesting that there s more talk than action
 now what ford is still generating fat profits from its mix of products in north america
 economic cycles are a fact of life in the auto business and ford is very well positioned to get through the next major downturn in the u
s
 meanwhile it s still generating strong profits in asia and its operation in europe has recently returned to profitability
 meanwhile i think the threat of disruption is greatly overblown at least in the near term
 silicon valley darling tesla motors has yet to prove that it can generate a sustainable profit and other potential rivals are at least several years way from building a single car assuming that they even try
 at current prices ford s dividend yield is hovering around 5 and it s likely to be able to sustain that dividend even if the market slumps
 for long term ford investors there s no big reason to sell now
