car investors take note there s big news on wall street this morning as swiss megabanker credit suisse takes out its big red pen and marks down shares of ford motor nyse f to underperform
 the news in a terse note reported on streetinsider
com this morning investment bank credit suisse announced that it s cutting its rating on ford stock from neutral to underperform
 at the same time as it did so however credit suisse left its price target on the stock unchanged at 13 per share nearly 12 higher than where the shares sit today 
 why the disconnect and why doesn t credit suisse think ford is a buy despite the shares being undervalued and should you even care read on to find out
 fact 1 ford can t make its guidance as the fool s own john rosevear reported last month ford earned a record profit last year 7
4 billion worth of greenbacks and generated operating cash flow nearly as strong 7
3 billion
 performance in the all important north american market looked particularly strong with pre tax profits leaping 26 
 and yet according to credit suisse north america or na as it says is precisely the problem
 with americans buying light trucks hand over fist ford is predicting that 2016 profits will be equal to or greater than what we saw in 2015
 but credit suisse warns that na ebit guidance is 
 overly optimistic
 says the analyst pricing mix gains from new product launches in na have been fully offset by material cost increases
 translation ford is going to miss guidance
 media ford s f 150 doesn t look so tough to credit suisse

 fact 2 it s not just north america continuing to bang the gong of worry credit suisse says that even outside of north america global inventories 
 have fallen meaningfully out of step with demand
 so even if ford sold nearly 150 billion in wares last year credit suisse sees this not as an indicator of sales strength but of channel stuffing
 were we to stuff this banker s theory into a nutshell crack it open and read what it says the answer would go like this ford has pushed too much inventory into the market and paid too high costs to build it
 since demand isn t there ford will be forced to cut prices and boost incentives to move inventory this year and profits will fall
 fact 3 general motors is a better bargain right now in a side note credit suisse observed that it thinks general motors nyse gm stock offers a better bargain than ford today and they may be right
 at 4
7 times earnings general motors stock certainly looks cheaper than ford and its 6
4 p e ratio
 similarly gm s 5
3 dividend yield beats out the 5 divvy that ford pays its investors
 the 45 billion debt load that general motors carries also looks easier to bear than the 112 billion in debt tottering atop ford s balance sheet albeit admittedly much of this debt is loans to ford car buyers 
 and one more thing
 the one piece missing out of this puzzle so far and the one that should perhaps interest investors who ve seen credit suisse s downgrade most is this how good of an analyst is credit suisse do these guys even known what they re talking about the answer is yes unfortunately they do
 according to our data here at motley fool caps where we ve been tracking credit suisse s performance as an analyst for nearly a decade this swiss investment banker is one of the best analysts of american stocks you ll find
 our stats confirm that over the past 10 years credit suisse has outperformed 88 of the investors we track and scored an average outperformance of the s p 500 of better than 11 percentage points per pick
 credit suisse has been especially good at picking automotive winners where 62 of its recommendations have beat the market including two past sell recommendations on ford
 which as you might have noticed
is exactly what credit suisse is telling investors to do today
