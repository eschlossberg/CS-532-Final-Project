as an investor in ford motor company nyse f i find it s important to keep up to date on the automaker s current events
 that has become increasingly difficult in the hectic automotive industry which serves up a seemingly unlimited amount of financial sales data earnings reports vehicle launches and more
 when considering ford s global sales data keeping track of its gains and losses in its three most critical markets is a good place to start
 here are the highlights from ford s first month of 2016 in china europe and of course right here in america
 ford soars in china detroit s second largest automaker recorded an excellent january in china

 note that the change in line color on the chart above indicates ford switching from reporting wholesale sales to retail sales
 while the retail numbers will be a slightly lower number than wholesale it didn t slow ford down much
 the carmaker posted an excellent finish to 2015 and started 2016 on the right foot
 driving ford s record january results in china were suvs with the ecosport kuga escape edge explorer and everest notching more than 37 000 units sold up 75 from the prior year s january
 ford s passenger cars still dominate total sales though and the escort set a record with nearly 29 000 units sold in january a sixfold increase from the prior year s january
 light at the end of the tunnel china wasn t the only place overseas where ford managed to increase its sales
 for years investors have waited patiently for ford s operations in europe to generate a profit and for years their patience was met with hundreds of millions of dollars in annual losses
 finally in 2015 ford broke through and generated an annual profit in the region with some help from changes in its pension accounting
 ford continues to increase its sales in the region and an increase in suvs and a fresh lineup of vehicles should sustain the company s success
 it was ford s best january in europe since 2012 with sales reaching 96 900 in its 20 traditional european markets
 that was a 10 increase over the prior january result and fueled a 20 basis point market share gain to a total of 7
9 
 similar to the situation in china ford s european suv sales were key drivers of the gains with the ecosport and kuga sales checking in at 50 and 19 higher respectively
 in fact ford expects the launch of the new edge suv to help drive suv sales 30 higher in the region during 2016
 if that prediction proves true 2016 will be the first time ford s annual suv sales in europe top 200 000
 one of ford s core strategies was to continue investing in its european vehicle lineup even at a time when it was struggling to narrow bottom line losses
 ford is continuing to implement that strategy with plans to launch seven new and refreshed vehicles in europe this year
 it s pretty simple newer car designs sell better and generally carry higher transaction prices so investors should remain optimistic that even better days are ahead for ford in europe
 mixed bag of results the only potential blemish on ford s january sales numbers came at home in the u
s
 market
 it has been difficult for investors to decide how to grade ford s january sales in the u
s
 the market that produces the vast majority of the company s revenue
 total sales dropped 2
6 to 173 723 units worse than the industry s 0
4 drop overall and a poor result compared to its detroit counterparts fiat chrysler automobiles which notched a 6
9 gain and general motors which gained 0
5 
 however ford didn t do as poorly as toyota or volkswagen which recorded sales declines of 4
7 and 6
9 respectively compared to january 2015
 the downside to ford s sales decline was that it happened during a month when ford s sales to fleets increased by 20 
 that means that ford s retail sales were much worse than its 2
6 decline in total sales suggests retail sales fell by 11 in january
 that compares poorly to general motors 9 increase in retail sales during the same time period
 on the bright side sales of suvs and trucks continue to juice ford s average transaction price which was up a staggering 1 800 per vehicle in january nearly three times the industry s average gain for the month
 that brings us to our next set of mixed results
 ford s most popular and best selling vehicle the f series full size truck was selling on average for 2 500 more than it was last january and even sweeter sales incentives for it declined 500
 essentially each truck driven off dealership lots was really profitable for ford during january
 on the downside total sales for the f series declined by 5 to 51 540 units
 while ford considers any month when it sells more than 50 000 f series trucks a solid month january was still a bit disappointing considering the last few years of results

 also while the decline in f series sales was a bummer investors should take it with a grain of salt because december was the first month in a decade that ford sold more than 80 000 f series trucks
 it s very possible december s holiday deals pulled some demand forward from january and if you average out the two months it s still a very strong result
 ultimately while the u
s
 was a mixed bag of results there s no reason to panic
 investors should be thrilled that ford continues to increase its sales in europe and that china s purchase tax incentive has been a huge success in fueling sales that had sputtered over the summer
