 accenture and digital asset holdings are key members of the hyperledger project a high profile initiative spearheaded by the linux foundation which wants to develop develop a new open source blockchain separated from the bitcoin blockchain
 the development of blockchain technology has the potential to redefine the operations and economics of the financial services industry said richard lumb chief executive of accenture s financial services
 accenture and digital asset holdings support closed permissioned blockchains that would offer the advantages of digital currencies fast and cheap transactions permanently recorded in a shared distributed ledger without the troublesome openness of the bitcoin network where anyone can be a node on the network anonymously
 instead of anonymous miners only banks and vetted financial operators would be allowed to validate transactions in permissioned blockchains
 to be used by financial institutions including capital markets firms and insurers blockchains must supplant the costly methods introduced by bitcoin with a mechanism that guarantees security privacy and speed without paying for anonymous consensus said two accenture executives in july
 with private chains you can have a completely known universe of transaction processors digital asset holdings ceo blythe masters said in september
 that appeals to financial institutions that are wary of the bitcoin blockchain
 other experts including legendary cryptographer nick szabo strongly argued that financial operators should instead embrace the crowd sourced power and resiliency of permissionless blockchains like bitcoin
 bitcoin magazine reached out to treat to find out more about accenture s position in the permissionless vs
 permissioned blockchain debate
 permissionless blockchain solutions were driven by the desire to transfer value whether cryptocurrency or other digital assets without the need for a trusted third party treat told bitcoin magazine
 that has tremendous power but also distinct limits in terms of use cases and scalability
 permissioned blockchain solutions tip the dynamic towards groups of known actors who can message transfer and validate transactions in a number of ways with the necessary controls e

 they are less constrained by latency and scalability challenges which opens a multitude of opportunities for financial institutions to remove inefficiencies
 permissioned based solutions enable faster and more scalable consensus mechanisms because the nodes are controlled by known chosen actors added treat
 in a permissioned environment the ledger can be engineered along a much wider array of consensus mechanisms including multi signature practical byzantine fault tolerant proof of stake zero knowledge proof etc
