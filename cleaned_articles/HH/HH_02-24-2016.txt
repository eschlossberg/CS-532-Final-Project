heineken is hoping to take advantage of the appetite for craft premium cider and has launched a new brand built around the heritage of it s producer familie stassen which the brewer acquired in 2012
 heineken approached design agency bulletproof to create the brand identity packaging design and brand visual identity for cidrerie stassen
 the agency looked to belgian art nouveau which was gathering momentum at the same time as léon stassen founded the brewery in 1895 in belgium and designed a ribbon wrapped around the stassen family apple tree
 the colours on the branding have been created to flex to differentiate the more premium tiered products in the range for the cuvee rosé and cuvee brut variants while the date the company was founded and the names of the four generations of master brewers sit within the branding to reinforce the brand s heritage
