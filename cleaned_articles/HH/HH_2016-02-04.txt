 it s just another creative ploy appealing to the fairly cynical millennials aitken said
 the ad was a clever concept but ultimately it was still encouraging young people to try heineken he said
 it s still trying to get you onto the treadmill of increasing your alcohol intake
 if heineken wanted to seriously promote moderate beer consumption they could advertise the health impacts of drinking he said

 they re attempting to position heineken as the brand for intelligent guys who have more important goals than getting pissed
 to coincide with the ad s release heineken released findings from research it commissioned on millennials drinking attitudes
 a survey of 150 new zealanders aged between 18 and 29 who consumed alcohol at least occasionally found 82 per cent tried to limit the amount of alcohol they drank on nights out
 those surveyed did not find drunkenness attractive in themselves or others with 54 per cent saying they were turned off by drunks and 19 per cent saying they had stayed sober to impress someone
 nearly one third 31 per cent said they had experienced social shaming after appearing to be inebriated in a photo on social media
 moderating drinking was considered cool by 67 per cent of respondents while 80 per cent respected others that moderated their drinking
 forty three per cent had a night ruined by someone who was too drunk
 maud meijboom the marketing director of heineken owned brewery db said moderate drinking was a choice for an image conscious generation of kiwis who wanted to stay in control
 18 to 29 year olds have grown up in a world that is sharply different to previous generations with social media and technology fuelling increased awareness of self image meijboom said
 millennials also put a greater emphasis on healthy living she said
 the new ad goes to air on friday night
