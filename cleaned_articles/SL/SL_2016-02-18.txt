earlier this month the renowned cabaret voltaire celebrated a century of operation
 yet despite its notoriety as the birthplace of dada the zurich theater has been struggling financially and management is now attempting to sell the club as a 13
1 million sculpture
 adrian notz the director of cabaret voltaire told swiss info that he s trying to sell the club as a gesamtkunstwerk
 it would be nice to offer the sculpture as a living space for artists who would manage the house and run it as a slightly more international meeting place says notz
 the art market is currently so crazy that it might actually work the building is owned by insurance behemoth swiss life and these plans are contingent on the company s willingness to sell
 according to the art newspaper swiss life collects an annual sum of 317 000 chf 315 000 in rent
 in addition the non profit needs 502 000 chf 500 000 in operations costs
 in the past these expenses were subsidized by the city government and other private players
 but in 2008 the right wing udc party opposed municipal funding for the establishment and the watchmaker swatch subsequently withdrew financial sponsorship

 as a result of these cuts the cabaret voltaire has largely been left to its own devices in the years that followed relying on its shop bar events and performances for income
 if management succeeds in attracting their desired investor the cabaret voltaire looks forward to plans of expanding its reach
 it would be good to transform the cabaret voltaire into a center for artists to manage the place notz said and give it a more international dimension
 the building has experienced funding issues before and drastic measures have been taken to keep it afloat
 in 2002 conceptual artist mark divo thwarted plans of demolition by creating a nonstop happening which involved thousands of visitors to the site
