the alternative dada art movement faces a financial fight for survival
 the answer to the problem turn its zurich birthplace into a work of art and find a collector who will buy it for the princely sum of chf13 million 12
8 million 
 that s the reserve price that has been slapped on cabaret voltaire in a bid to secure dada s future during its centenary year
 now it is just a question of finding a deep pocketed art lover who can envisage the unassuming building nestled among cobbled side streets in zurich s old town as a sculpture or oil painting
 the novel idea was the brainchild of swiss artist kerim seiler
 cabaret voltaire director adrian notz is convinced that it will not only solve dada s immediate financial problems but will also allow the birthplace of the provocative art form to flourish free of future economic restraints and political bickering
 it would be nice to have the sculpture as a residence for artists who would also run it and open it up as a more international venue
 that would be a very strong gesture for art
 the art market is so crazy at the moment it might actually work he told swissinfo
ch
 any future benefactor as yet completely unknown would be expected to buy into the dada movement and not just convert the building into apartments
 you would not buy a van gogh cut it up and make a carpet out of it because you know it s an art work said notz
 in the same sense you would not want to change anything in cabaret voltaire
 the plan is for a future owner to permanently loan the building to dada artists
 the theatre was after all reborn as the home of dada in 2002 reopening properly in 2004 precisely because it was the very spot where anti war artists hugo ball and emmy hennings started the movement in 1916
 cabaret voltaire dada artists response to wwi by julie hunt zurich was the birthplace of the dada movement and its opposition to the cultural values artists believed had led to the first world war
 in depth first world war culture see in other languages 5 financial burden kerim seiler says he wants to re programme people into perceiving cabaret voltaire as an historical monument 
 it should not be about who owns it
 it s not a piece of material a tool for making money he told swissinfo
ch
 it s a place where a couple of migrants ball and hennings did things that changed our perception of existence
 selling cabaret voltaire to an art collector may sound to some people idealistic and perhaps unrealistic on the surface
 but it might not necessarily be just a pipe dream or a publicity stunt
 eight years ago a wealth swiss art lover did express an interest in buying the theatre
 the financial crash put paid to that proposed deal but it proved to notz that the concept was worth reviving
 but why the need for such a drastic and ground breaking move the building is owned by insurance giant swiss life which charges chf315 000 rent annually
 the non profit enterprise burns roughly chf500 000 more in running costs each year
 swatch s chf300 000 sponsorship ended several years ago and money from cultural foundations has all but dried up
 dada is not the right image for banks and it is difficult to find sponsors in general in the current economic climate said notz
 swiss foundations are focused on swiss artists and projects
 dada was born here but it s not very swiss
 despite this we manage to get some support from foundations
 sex slaves and scandals zurich city council pays cabaret voltaire s rent but not without a fair amount of political opposition from the conservative right swiss people s party
 they are not too fond of taxpayers money being spent on the home of such provocative acts as the live casting of sex slaves and a couple whose performance included urinating on each other
 the people s party launched an unsuccessful initiative in 2008 that called on voters to veto the council decision to financially support the venue
 and they did not mince their words in a 2013 postulate protesting plans to help bankroll dada s centenary jubilee
 zurich s cabaret voltaire remains a popular attraction 100 years dada the art movement that questioned everything by christian raaflaub zurich dadaism is the only artistic movement that started in switzerland and conquered the world
 culture human interest see in other languages 9 the postulate condemned chf4 million of city funds spent between 2003 and 2013 on reviving dadaism in zurich resulting in ten years of flops scandals and fleeing sponsors 
 dadaism is described as absurd laughable nonsensical and embarrassing 
 it s initial anti war platform amid the bombs and gas of 1916 was little more than a fig leaf that has since fallen away completely according to the postulate
 dada may seem outrageous to some but it does not provoke merely for the sake of it counters notz
 it seeks to challenge stereotypes and remind people that there is life beyond the conformity demanded by the establishment
 dada zeitgeist caught between cold reality of market forces and the heat of abrasive politics cabaret voltaire needs to break free in order to survive and flourish
 a successful crowdfunding scheme raised chf100 000 for the centenary celebrations but notz does not think this is a sustainable option apart from occasional special projects
 the theatre does make money from running a shop a bar and renting out space for artistic performances birthdays and weddings and corporate christmas parties
 but not enough for financial independence
 a wealthy art loving patron is therefore required to give the home of dada breathing space as it looks to the next 100 years
 if you talk about dada as a zeitgeist it does not depend on this place said notz
 but people being people they like to identify dada with a space
 it would not be a disaster for dada if cabaret voltaire went out of existence but it would be a disaster for zurich
 even if other places identity with dada such as paris or berlin there can only be one birthplace
 of course the revolutionary idea would only work if swiss life agrees to sell the building housing cabaret voltaire
 it s understandable that the house is the subject of creative thinking during this dada centenary year
 nevertheless we are not getting involved in any speculation the insurance company stated
 dada s 100th birthday the dada artistic movement was founded in zurich by a group of artists led by hugo ball and emmy hennings in 1916
 cabaret voltaire was set up as a venue for dada art and performances
 the theatre ran into disrepair and was saved from demolition in 2002 by a group of artists led by mark divo who illegally occupied the building to prevent its destruction
 it opened for business again on september 30 2004 complete with a subsidy from the city
 dada was initially an artistic expression of protest against the horrors of the first world war rejecting established conventions with an anti aesthetic and often shocking style
 there are various interpretations of how the movement got its name with many believing it was just a nonsensical word chosen to display the movement s contempt of logic
 it swiftly spread throughout europe and the united states and was at its peak between 1916 and 1920
 officially launching on march 5 the movement s 100th jubilee celebrations will be marked in zurich with a series of exhibitions and performances throughout the year
