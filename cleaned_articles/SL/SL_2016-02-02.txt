com chantal gallad√© a member of the security policy commission for the national council expressed her concern and demanded an immediate halt to the issue of military firearms according to the newspaper blick
 her colleague beat flach finds it absurd that swiss rail has to return two firearms to the military every month
 it must be possible to stop soldiers taking their guns home
 national councillor thomas hurter didn t hide his displeasure
 it s unbelievable
 members of the military have a special responsibility to safeguard their weapons
 at the same time he didn t want to dramatise the situation
 if we compare 18 firearms to the 15 000 people recruited into the swiss military each year the number is relatively small
 the same annual report revealed other interesting information
 there were 242 incidents involving weapons and ammunition
 in addition there were 13 military vehicle accidents which resulted in 3 deaths and 55 injuries and 546 cases of possession or consumption of drugs
