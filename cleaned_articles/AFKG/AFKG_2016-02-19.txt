air france klm makes progress in 2015 but still has more to do
 labour productivity is at the heart air france klm s 2015 was a big improvement on its strike hit 2014 but it highlighted the progress that it still needs to make
 it returned to net profit for the first time in six financial years and achieved its best operating margin since before the global financial crisis although this was below its previous peak
 in the passenger network business long haul profits soared and medium haul losses narrowed
 lcc brand transavia made another loss but laid plans for its first base outside the netherlands and france to be established in munich in mar 2016
 in the cargo segment losses deteriorated in spite of capacity cuts especially in its full freighter operation
 air france klm generated a return on capital employed of 8
6 in 2015 a leap from 1
7 in 2014 but short of its 2017 target range of 9 to 11 
 as the world airline industry already approaches levels of profitability higher than previous cyclical highs air france klm will need continued assistance from the global cycle
 it will also need a new agreement on labour productivity particularly with air france flight crew
 air france klm s first annual net profit since mar 2011 air france klm returned to profit in 2015 turning a net loss of eur225 million in 2014 into a positive net result of eur118 million
 the operating result improved from a loss of eur129 million in 2014 to a profit of eur816 million in 2015
 the 2014 result was adversely affected by pilot strikes without which air france klm would have reported an operating profit of eur296 million
 group asks including lcc transavia grew by 2

 in 2015 the group achieved only its third positive operating profit since the year to mar 2008 although the 2015 operating margin of 3

 at the end of 2015 its net debt fell by eur1
1 billion or 20 year on year to eur4
3 billion
 with the exception of the strike affected 2014 it has successfully lowered net debt every year from its 2011 peak of eur6
5 billion
 year end cash was eur3
8 billion up 7 from 2014 which was equivalent to 53 days of revenue
 this reduction in net debt has been achieved by ensuring that annual capital investment is kept below the level of operating cash flow generated
 in 2015 its capex was eur1
6 billion which was more than the eur1
2 billion spent in 2014 but less than the eur2

 the group plans to increase capex to eur1

 it is committed to a further significant reduction in net debt in 2016
 air france klm development of net debt and cash 2005 2015 source capa centre for aviation air france klm passenger network segment drives the group result the passenger network segment is the most important division in the air france klm group and its result is the main driver of the group result
 in 2015 the passenger network division reported an operating result of eur842 million up from a loss of eur86 million in 2014
 note that the name of this segment has been changed to passenger network from the shorter passenger in order to highlight that it includes only the network airlines air france klm and hop and not the point to point airline transavia
 since the formation of air france klm in 2004 the group has only once made a positive annual operating result in a year when the passenger network business has made a loss this was the year to mar 2011 
 the group s profitability very much depends on that of its biggest segment

 although official audited sub segment results are not reported air france klm has released its estimates of the operating result in each area for a couple of years now
 according to these estimates the long haul network made more than the whole business achieving an operating result of eur1 140 million in 2015 up from eur740 million in 2014 the 2014 figure is before the impact of the pilot strikes 
 long haul asks were up 1

 this like for like rask performance was down at a similar rate 3
2 in 4q2015 but a significant cause of the weakness in the final quarter was the paris terrorist attacks in nov 2015
 on a conference call to discuss the 2015 results air france klm management told analysts that the underlying 4q trend was a little better 0
7 and that the paris impact was now receding
 however cfo pierre francois riolacci stressed that there was a high degree of volatility in unit revenue from month to month and that the group was cautious about the outlook for this indicator
 he added that european market capacity growth would be around 7 on long haul and 6 on medium haul in summer 2016
 there were no worrisome features in jan 2016 but he expected feb 2016 and mar 2016 to be a bit weaker albeit without the bloodshed anticipated by a large low cost carrier 
 cargo segment losses widen in spite of full freighter cuts although the passenger network segment remains critical to the group s results there is a wide range of profitability among the other segments
 the cargo segment continues to weigh on the group s profit and its operating loss worsened from eur212 million in 2014 to eur245 million in 2015
 air france klm blamed structural air cargo industry overcapacity
 cargo unit revenue fell by 5
6 as reported and by 12
8 excluding the favourable impact of currency movements in spite of a 4
5 cut in cargo capacity atks 
 the group s strategic reduction in full freighter capacity is helping to limit losses in the cargo division
 from 25 full freighters in 2008 it will have just nine in jun 2016 two 777 fs at paris cdg and three 747 erfs at amsterdam 
 air france klm s full freighter capacity was down 23 in 2015
 operating losses from its full freighter operations narrowed from eur97 million in 2014 to eur42 million in 2015
 it targets breakeven in this area in 2017
 maintenance segment has highest margin the maintenance segment increased its operating profit from eur174 million in 2014 to eur214 million in 2015 with revenue up 18

 transavia another loss in 2015 growth to accelerate in 2016 lcc subsidiary transavia which comprises transavia netherlands and transavia france made another operating loss in 2015 loss of eur35 million versus eur36 million loss in 2014 in spite of revenue growth of 4

 air france klm said that its operating result was in line with its plan and that it remains on course to break even in 2017
 transavia will grow asks at the faster rate of 15 in 2016 with transavia france growing by 20 
 air france ceo frédéric gagey told analysts on the 2015 results conference call that the process of transferring slots from air france to transavia at paris orly in order to serve leisure destinations was now complete
 the next phase was to grow its routes from provincial french cities in addition to expanding the business into new european destinations
 under the netherlands arm of transavia the lcc brand will open a munich base in mar 2015
 management expects the munich base to have a lower cost base than existing transavia operations in france and the netherlands in spite of munich s relatively high airport charges
 this is thanks to a new contract for flight crew in particular pilots the outsourcing of ground operations and a lack of additional overhead
 munich is expected to be a relatively high yield market
 further development of transavia across europe will require pilot agreement air france klm s 2015 results presentation indicates that transavia s fleet will grow to more than 65 aircraft in 2017 which is still smaller than the lcc fleets of its rival european legacy groups lufthansa with eurowings and iag with vueling 
 moreover all three of these legacy owned lccs will be much smaller than the leading independent european lccs
 see related report transavia munich to be first base outside home markets but air france klm s lcc still lacks scale transavia integration a medium term plan air france klm ceo alexandre de juniac told analysts that a plan for air france klm to integrate the management and ownership of the two halves of transavia into a single holding company was probably mid term 
 it would offer advantages in terms of efficiency and strategic focus and would be a simpler tool with which to participate in what mr de juniac called the lcc consolidation that will naturally happen in europe 
 the merits of integrating transavia under one structure are such that air france klm would be better off making this a short term plan
 however the development of the lcc remains a highly political subject particularly in france and the first priority for transavia related pilot negotiations is to agree its further expansion into european markets outside france and the netherlands
 klm more profitable than air france both major groups within the air france klm group enjoyed an improvement in both revenue and operating profit in 2015
 air france increased revenue by 5
7 to eur16 477 million and its operating result turned from a loss of eur314 million in 2014 this would have been a profit of eur99 million without the pilot strike to a profit of eur462 million in 2015
 klm s revenue increased by 2
7 to eur9 905 million and its operating result rose from eur175 million in 2014 to eur384 million in 2015
 klm s operating margin of 3
9 again beat that of its larger sister company air france whose margin was 2
8 
 nevertheless 2015 was significant for air france in that it was its first year of positive operating profit since the year to mar 2008

0 to 1
4 maintaining its tight capacity discipline it has typically remained in a range of 1 to 2 in recent years 
 air france will reduce capacity by 2 klm will grow by 3 and transavia will accelerate to ask growth of 15 
 although it maintains an average unit cost reduction target of 1
5 pa for 2015 2017 its target for 2016 is a reduction of only 1 in spite of further fuel savings
 it currently expects its fuel bill to be eur4
5 billion in 2016 compared with eur6
2 billion in 2015 and eur6
6 billion in 2014
 air france klm estimates that it retained only 30 of the benefit of lower fuel prices in 2015 the balance being offset by the weaker eur versus usd and more particularly by unit revenue weakness
 it expects that similar factors will again offset a significant part of its fuel savings in 2016
 nevertheless it expects improved free cash flow and this implies improved profit levels in 2016 although it has not set a profit target 
 2017 and beyond much depends on labour productivity for 2017 the group s capacity plan will depend on the outcome of employee negotiations over labour productivity improvements particularly at air france
 in oct 2015 the french airline decided to cut its long haul asks by 10 from 2015 to 2017 with the larger part of the cut deferred to 2017 after failing to reach a new agreement with flight crew unions
 mr de juniac told analysts that air france could return to growth on long haul in 2017 if a satisfactory productivity agreement could be reached with labour representatives
 the group ceo also said that air france klm was watching the development of the long haul low cost model very closely and considering whether it was possible for the group to do something in this segment
 however he stressed that his first duty was to solve the problems in the mainline and a long haul low cost business would not achieve this
 it is significant that air france klm s future growth is linked to labour productivity
 in 2015 it achieved virtually stable overall capacity total atks 0

5 fewer employees
 labour productivity in atk per employee increased by 1

2 source capa analysis of air france klm results so in 2015 some labour productivity indicators improved and some deteriorated
 nevertheless in absolute terms air france in particular remains a laggard on labour productivity compared with other european legacy airlines and needs to improve significantly
 air france klm is right to put labour productivity improvement at the heart of its plans
