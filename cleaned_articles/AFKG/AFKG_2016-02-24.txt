 we now focus on the mainline carriers because we think that our first duty is to solve the problems of the group s mainlines mainly by improving their competitiveness problem air france klm ceo alexandre de juniac told analysts on the group s earnings conference call last week
 if you develop a long haul low cost it s very nice business but it doesn t solve your mainline problems
 nonetheless he pointed out that the franco dutch group which recently reported its first full year profit in years is very closely watching the segment
 it s not only norwegian
 you have long haul low cost in every part of the world de juniac said citing singapore airlines air canada and lufthansa as carriers that have started operations with this model
 he said that initially the long haul startups were not convincing but that they are becoming increasingly so
 so we have to see whether or not and if it s possible to do something in air france klm
 but the key priority is to solve the mainline competitiveness problem
 meanwhile air france klm remains committed to growing its short haul low cost subsidiary transavia as part of its ongoing transform 2020 restructuring plan
 the division has two airlines transavia holland and transavia france
 the lcc s total capacity measured in available seat kilometers asks is scheduled to increase 15 this year after growing 5
3 in 2015
 the main contributors to this year s capacity growth again will be transavia france which last year increased its asks by 24
6 and the march opening of transavia holland s new munich base
 it initially will have four boeing 737 800s operating 101 weekly frequencies to 18 destinations in summer
 munich is a relatively expensive airport in terms of charges though de juniac maintains the operations there will have lower unit costs than those of transavia in its home markets
 that is because the airline has negotiated a contract for munich based crew particularly pilots that is less expensive than agreements with transavia holland and transavia france individually
 the munich operation s only ground staff will be one person coordinating operations he said
 transavia holland will manage operations meaning there will be no additional overhead or administrative costs in munich
 de juniac also noted that munich is a high income area and that the price of the average ticket is higher than it could be in other areas of germany or europe in which the average purchasing level is probably lower
 transavia france last year became paris orly airport s largest international lcc according to de juniac
 the lcc was able to grow at france s second busiest airport thanks to the transfer of slots to transavia from air france
 air france ceo frederic gagey believes this was really a good strategy
 it s clear that by operating this transfer of slots from air france to transavia we have kept our good position into orly
 this summer transavia france will be operating more than 20 aircraft at orly
 transavia s development in orly will have a limit gagey said
 the next step is to develop transavia outside of paris and establish french provincial bases
 this however requires an agreement with pilots
 discussions are ongoing
 transavia holland pilots signed a new collective labor agreement last year
 the planned ramp up of transavia comes despite the fact that the lcc recorded operating losses in 2014 and 2015
 its 2015 loss was 35 million 1 million less than the loss for 2014
 air france klm projects the lcc will break even in 2017
 transavia s fleet is set to expand to more than 65 aircraft over the next two years excluding short term leases from 53 aircraft in 2015
 passenger numbers in 2015 rose 5
4 to 10
8 million and load factor remained stable at 89

 total revenues stood at 1

 de juniac intends to bring both transavia carriers under the direct control of the air france klm holding company and under one management team to improve the efficiency to be able to draw all the synergies and to have a more critical mass
 klm however has resisted the move
 klm owns all of transavia holland and 40 of transavia france
 it s not a short term or an immediate issue but it s probably a midterm issue and especially if we want to participate into the low cost consolidation that should happen in europe he said
