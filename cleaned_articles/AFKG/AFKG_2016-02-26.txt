 profits at british airways parent company international airlines group iag soared 64
4pc to 1
8bn last year as the company continues to go from strength to strength
 fuel costs for the year were down 6
3pc and would have been 17
2pc lower but for a rise in the value of the dollar
 yesterday the group s shares rose 5
3p to 558
5p on the back of falling crude prices
 revenues for the airline giant stood at almost 22
9bn 13
3pc higher than the previous year and it expects operating profit will grow by a similar degree this year
 more trans atlantic flights and the company s increased number of discount flights pushed passenger revenue up 14
2pc to 20
4bn
 the airline carried 88 333 000 passengers last year up from 77 334 000 a year previously and the surge in numbers means the group is now bigger than german carrier lufthansa and is gaining rapidly on air france klm
 north america continued to be the largest part of iag s business with the highest number of passengers although the group expects a surge in passenger numbers travelling within europe as the threat of terrorism hits other markets particularly north africa
 the strong results cap a period of growth for iag which was formed in 2011 when british airways merged with spain s iberia following a tough restructuring of the business which included heavy job losses at iberia and cost savings at ba
 iberia had been struggling before the merger but lower overheads allowed iag boss willie walsh to return the business to profit
 in october iag unveiled its first dividend since its formation and today announced a full year dividend of 0
20 per share
 in august last year the company bought irish carrier aer lingus which contributed 35m to group operating profit last year
 mr walsh said iag had no plans for further acquisitions at the moment but continued to look for opportunities
 mr walsh said it had undoubtedly been a good year but pointed to the challenges arising from increasing volatility in the currency and fuel markets
 because the business pays for its fuel through contracts agreed in advance and in dollars it is not fully benefiting from the drop in the cost of fuel
 following the sale last night of london s city airport to a consortium of three canadian pension funds ontario teachers pension plan otpp borealis and aimco and wren house an infrastructure investment vehicle owned by the sovereign wealth fund of kuwait mr walsh reiterated his threat to pull british airways jets from the airport if the new owners raise fees
 they should know early on that we would not continue the same amount of activity at london city if they increase the prices he said
 he said increased fees would mean increased ticket costs and that choice in the market would mean customers would vote with their feet
